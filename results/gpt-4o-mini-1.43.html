<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I hope our agreement regarding GAL and RUM still holds. I am moving A WAR to SIL. This is not intended as an act of aggression, but rather as a precautionary measure. I trust you will reciprocate by not moving into GAL or RUM.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I propose a truce. Our conflict in the Balkans is benefiting neither of us. I am willing to withdraw from SER if you agree to allow me to expand into GRE. This would allow us to focus on other threats. Let me know if you are interested in a more peaceful resolution.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I apologize for the recent aggression. I was misled by false intelligence. I propose a truce and a return to the status quo. I will move my army from Budapest back to Trieste if you agree to withdraw your forces from Greece. This will allow us to focus on mutual threats.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot withdraw from Budapest while you occupy Trieste.
