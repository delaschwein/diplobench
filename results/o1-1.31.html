<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings from Vienna. I suggest a DMZ in Tyrolia and assurance that neither of us intrudes on Trieste or Venice. I’m keen for a southern expansion and would prefer we cooperate rather than clash. Let’s keep the peace between us while we look for gains elsewhere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Friend of the north, I propose we keep Galicia empty to prevent early friction. A DMZ there frees us both to focus on more profitable directions. Let me know your thoughts on forging a stable eastern relationship.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Sultan, I offer a cordial understanding: you take Bulgaria while I move to Serbia and, hopefully soon, Greece as well. If we avoid conflict in the Balkans, we can both profit. Let’s keep a channel open for cooperation.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, Russia is interested in understanding your intentions in the Balkans. We believe that cooperation between our nations could be mutually beneficial in preventing other powers from gaining influence in the region. What are your goals?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria and Italy, Germany proposes a discussion regarding the Balkans. We believe a coordinated approach to maintaining stability in the region is crucial. Let us explore potential areas of cooperation and prevent any unilateral actions that could destabilize the region. What are your interests in the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, Italy seeks a peaceful resolution to tensions in the Adriatic. We propose a mutual guarantee of borders. Italy will not move against Trieste if Austria does not move against Venice. This will allow us both to focus on other threats. Do you agree to this proposal?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings, Austria. I wish to establish a dialogue regarding our shared border. I am concerned about your growing influence in the Balkans. I propose we maintain the status quo for the time being and avoid any actions that could destabilize the region. What are your intentions regarding Serbia and Greece?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, let’s confirm we keep Galicia clear. I intend to focus on Serbia and Greece, not infringing to the north or east, and I respectfully suggest you do the same with your units so we avoid collisions. I’m open to mutual cooperation for mutual gain.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I gladly accept your proposal for border peace: no moves on Venice or Trieste, plus a DMZ in Tyrolia. I plan to secure Serbia and possibly Greece, so I’d prefer we remain friendly neighbors while you pursue your interests in the west.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Sultan, I will be moving toward Serbia and likely eye Greece soon. I welcome your growth in Bulgaria; let’s not stand in each other’s way. There is no reason for friction if we respect these spheres and keep an open line of communication.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we appreciate your offer to keep Galicia empty. However, we are more interested in understanding your long-term goals in the Balkans. What territories do you seek to control? We are willing to consider a stable eastern relationship, but we need to understand your ambitions first. Are you willing to cede influence in Rumania to Russia?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I accept your proposal for a DMZ in Tyrolia and a guarantee of borders. Italy will not move against Trieste, and you will not move against Venice. This will allow us both to expand elsewhere. I suggest we publicly announce this agreement to deter any potential aggressors. Do you agree to this public announcement?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your offer to divide the Balkans is tempting, but I am wary of your ambitions in Serbia and Greece. I am willing to consider an agreement where I secure Bulgaria, but I need assurances that you will not encroach further into Ottoman territories or interests. What guarantees can you provide?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria and Italy, regarding the Balkans, Germany proposes a joint strategy. We believe Austria should have primary influence in Serbia and Romania, while Italy focuses on Greece and Albania. Germany will act as a mediator and guarantor of stability. This division of influence will prevent conflict and ensure a peaceful region. Let's discuss the details.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, if you seek Rumania, I can respect that claim so long as Galicia remains free and you maintain a light touch on our shared border. I aim to secure Serbia and Greece, nothing more eastward. Let’s ensure we stay out of each other’s way for mutual gain.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I agree to a public announcement of our border pact. Declaring a DMZ in Tyrolia and guaranteeing Trieste-Venice neutrality will deter distractions and let us focus elsewhere. Let’s finalize that publicly, and then each pursue our expansions with peace of mind.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR, GER]: Sultan and Chancellor, I appreciate Germany’s role in the Balkans. A fair balance would see Austria taking Serbia and Greece, and Turkey holding Bulgaria, with no further Austrian incursions eastward. This ensures regional stability under Berlin’s friendly guidance.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we acknowledge your intention to focus on Serbia and Greece. Russia will focus on Rumania and Turkey. We propose a non-aggression pact to avoid conflicts in the Balkans. We will keep Galicia clear, as you requested. Do you agree to these terms?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am glad we have reached an agreement on the Adriatic. I propose we publicly announce our agreement to deter any potential aggressors. This will strengthen our position and allow us to focus on other threats. Do you agree to this public announcement?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am concerned about your intentions in Serbia and Greece. I am willing to consider an agreement where I secure Bulgaria, but I need assurances that you will not encroach further into Ottoman territories or interests. What guarantees can you provide? I need something concrete.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria and Italy, regarding the Balkans, we need to move beyond generalities. Austria, are you willing to commit to non-aggression towards Russia in exchange for German support in Serbia? Italy, can you guarantee that your focus on Greece and Albania will not destabilize the region or threaten Austrian interests? Germany is prepared to mediate, but we need concrete commitments from both of you.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I confirm a non-aggression pact and respect your claim to Rumania. Let Galicia remain empty, and I will focus on Serbia and Greece exclusively. May our eastern border stay calm as we each pursue our rightful gains.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Sultan, to allay your concerns: I promise not to advance on Bulgaria. My focus is strictly on Serbia and Greece, leaving Ottoman territories unthreatened. Let us maintain friendly ties and keep the Balkans stable.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA, GER]: Italy and Germany, I will publicly affirm the Tyrolia DMZ with Italy and guarantee no aggression against Venice or Trieste. Further, I pledge no hostilities against Russia, in exchange for German goodwill in the Balkans. Let us uphold this cooperative framework for a secure region.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am moving to Bulgaria. I expect you to stay out of my way. I will not tolerate any encroachment on Ottoman territories or interests. Consider this your final warning.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: To Austria and Italy, it seems we are at an impasse. Austria, your ambitions are too broad. Italy, your guarantees are insufficient. Germany will proceed with its own plans to ensure stability in the Balkans. Do not interfere.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we will respect your claim to Serbia and Greece. We will focus on Rumania. We will keep Galicia clear and maintain a light touch on our shared border. We will move A WAR to MOS to show our commitment to a non-aggressive stance.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am pleased we agree. Let's publicly announce our agreement regarding the DMZ in Tyrolia and the guarantee of Trieste-Venice neutrality. This will deter any potential aggressors and allow us to focus on our respective expansions. I will announce this publicly.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Talks centered on securing border pacts with ITA and RUS to focus on the Balkans. We confirmed a DMZ with ITA in Tyrolia and agreed to leave Galicia empty with RUS. TUR demanded no interference in Bulgaria, while GER criticized our Balkan ambitions. Overall, we aim for Serbia and Greece, ensuring minimal friction to our north and west while watching GER’s meddling and TUR’s warnings.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Push into Serbia and Greece, maintain a non-aggression stance with RUS, respect the DMZ with ITA (Trieste-Venice), and watch TUR and GER closely for potential threats or alliances.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings friend in Rome! I propose we maintain our good understanding by respecting the Tyrolia–Trieste border and letting me secure Greece this autumn. Your fleet in ION can focus westward instead, allowing us both to expand without clashing. If we keep our mutual trust, we will profit greatly in the seasons to come.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Esteemed compatriots in Moscow, I suggest we continue our cordial ties by upholding a DMZ in Galicia. I am wary of Germany’s maneuvers, so your cooperation would be greatly appreciated should they stray too far east. Together, we can ensure stability and discourage any opportunistic moves from Berlin.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Neighbors in Ankara, I see no reason for direct conflict if we both respect each other’s claims in the Balkans. I intend to move into Greece peacefully without threatening Bulgaria. Let us keep the peace between us, for there are better opportunities elsewhere than fighting one another.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Your planned move from WAR to MOS is welcomed. Let’s keep Galicia clear and maintain our cordial frontier while I turn south to secure Greece. If Germany grows too bold, our shared vigilance can keep them in check.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our non-aggression pact stands firm. I have no designs on your territory and trust your respect of Tyrolia as a DMZ. I plan to move my fleet from Albania to Greece this turn; I ask that your Ionian Fleet not interfere so we can both expand peacefully.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I acknowledge your sphere in Bulgaria and wish to avoid any clash in the Balkans. I aim to move into Greece without threatening your position. Let us keep the peace and focus on more fruitful opportunities than battling each other.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria, I appreciate your assurance that you will not interfere with my sphere of influence in the Balkans.

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I understand your reluctance about a DMZ in Galicia. My focus remains on securing Greece and stabilizing the Balkans. As long as you do not interfere there, I will respect our frontier. Let us keep the peace and remain vigilant against German expansion.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I assure you my move to Greece is neither hostile nor encroaching on Bulgaria. Securing Greece is a natural step for Austria, and I prefer to avoid contention along our shared borders. I urge you to see reason and channel our energies toward more pressing concerns than Balkan squabbles.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: We have both committed to non-aggression, and I trust your presence in Tyrol is purely protective. My intentions lie southward, aiming for Greece, not toward Venice. Let us keep our border quiet so we may each grow without needless conflicts.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I trust Tyrolia remains purely defensive. My fleet heads to Greece, and I ask that you keep the Ionian Sea clear so we can both expand without clashing. Our mutual friendship is worth far more than a contested Balkan shore.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I note your decision on Galicia and respect it. My focus stays in the Balkans, not on challenging you. Let us guard our respective fronts while watching Germany’s moves, so neither of us is caught off guard.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Salutations, friend. Let us keep Tyrolia and Trieste peaceful while you focus your forces elsewhere. I have no wish for conflict between our nations and will gladly stand together if Turkey becomes belligerent. Please let me know if you’re amenable to continued cooperation and a united defense.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Greetings. I value our understanding and would like to keep tensions low along our frontier. If you could shift your army in Galicia away from our border, it would solidify trust between us. I am open to mutual support should Turkey grow too adventurous in the Balkans. Your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Hello. I see your forces extending into the Balkans. I prefer avoiding a clash if we can find a workable boundary—perhaps a clear DMZ around Bulgaria. If we can settle a stable border, we both can focus on more immediate concerns elsewhere. Let me know your stance, and we can negotiate a friendly outcome.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I value our non-aggression pact. However, your move into Albania is concerning. Can you clarify your intentions in the Balkans? I want to ensure our agreement remains mutually beneficial and that no misunderstandings arise. I am open to discussing further guarantees to maintain stability in the region.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I must warn you against any aggressive moves into Greece or Serbia. The Balkans are of vital interest to the Ottoman Empire, and any encroachment will be met with strong resistance. I suggest we maintain a neutral stance.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I am moving A WAR to MOS. I hope this does not cause you any concern. I am focused on the south and do not wish to interfere with your interests in SER and GRE. Let's maintain our current understanding and avoid any unnecessary conflicts.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: My friend, the move to Albania is simply to secure our position against Turkish encroachment. I have no designs on your territory, and I reaffirm our desire to keep Trieste–Tyrolia quiet. If you seek additional assurances, let me know how we can best cooperate to maintain stability.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I understand your concerns, yet Greece and Serbia are firmly in Austrian hands, and we do not wish to see those territories contested. Let us formalize a stable boundary: we stay out of Bulgaria if you refrain from moving against Greece or Serbia. A clear demarcation should keep tensions low and benefit us both.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Thank you for the update. Your shifting of A WAR to MOS is a reassuring sign of good faith. I remain committed to our understanding and will keep a watchful eye on Turkish moves in the south. If you see cause for joint action, let me know and we can coordinate accordingly.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I appreciate your willingness to avoid conflict. A DMZ around Bulgaria is not acceptable. The Balkans are vital to my interests. I propose we maintain the status quo and avoid any aggressive moves. I will resist any encroachment on Ottoman territories.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your willingness to maintain peace in Tyrolia and Trieste. However, your move into Greece is concerning. Can you provide assurances that your intentions are not hostile towards Italian interests in the Adriatic? I propose a meeting to discuss further guarantees and solidify our non-aggression pact.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I understand your concern regarding Galicia. However, I must maintain a presence there to ensure the security of my southern territories. I am willing to discuss a mutual withdrawal if you are willing to offer concessions elsewhere. Perhaps we can discuss a joint guarantee of Bulgarian neutrality to counter Turkish expansionism?</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Friend, rest assured that my moves in Greece aim to deter Turkish aggression and not threaten your Adriatic interests. I propose we solidify our non-aggression pact by agreeing to mutually avoid hostile actions in the Adriatic and Tyrolia. Let us maintain trust so we can both focus on containing any destabilizing forces elsewhere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Your suggestion of a joint stance regarding Bulgarian neutrality has merit. While I understand your need to keep a presence in Galicia, I hope we can keep any build-up there minimal. I am prepared to work with you on countering any Turkish push into the Balkans, provided we uphold a spirit of mutual restraint and shared interests.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Since a full DMZ in Bulgaria does not appeal to you, I remain open to other boundaries that preserve our respective holdings without sparking conflict. My intent in Greece and Serbia is purely defensive, yet I will protect them fiercely if threatened. Let us keep the region stable by defining lines we do not cross, to our mutual benefit.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your assurances regarding Albania. However, I remain concerned about your intentions in Greece. To solidify our non-aggression pact, I propose a formal agreement guaranteeing the neutrality of the Adriatic Sea. I am willing to offer similar guarantees for Tyrolia and Trieste. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I cannot accept your terms regarding Greece and Serbia. The Balkans are of vital interest to me. I propose we maintain the status quo for now, but I will not hesitate to defend my interests if you encroach further. I suggest you focus on Italy.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I appreciate your commitment to our understanding. I am willing to discuss a joint guarantee of Bulgarian neutrality.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I value your partnership and reaffirm that Greece is not intended as a threat against you. I accept your proposal for a formal Adriatic neutrality and will refrain from any moves into Tyrolia or against your fleets. Let us maintain this accord so we can jointly manage any Turkish or other hostile advances.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I hear your refusal regarding Bulgaria, yet I remain intent on safeguarding Greece and Serbia. I propose we keep our existing borders to prevent needless conflict. As long as you respect our holdings, we have no cause to clash. Let us not squander our strength in a Balkan stalemate when there are other opportunities to pursue.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I agree a joint guarantee of Bulgarian neutrality benefits us both, and I am open to working together in the Balkans. I’m ready to support you if you secure Rumania, assuming you reciprocate by keeping Galicia calm. Let us coordinate to contain Turkish aggression and solidify our alliance going forward.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Negotiations were dominated by tensions over the Balkans. TUR refused to accept any arrangement in Bulgaria or recognize AUT’s holdings in Greece and Serbia, taking a hard line. ITA maintained a friendly stance, agreeing to Adriatic neutrality and mutual non-aggression, though they remain cautious. RUS suggested working together to contain TUR, offering support in exchange for help with Rumania and general restraint in Galicia. Overall, AUT is leaning toward closer cooperation with RUS and ITA while preparing to defend against potential Turkish aggression.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Forge a stronger alliance with RUS to counter TUR in the Balkans while preserving peace with ITA. Maintain a defensive posture in Greece and Serbia, ready to repel any Ottoman incursion. Continue to nurture cooperation with ITA to secure the Adriatic and Tyrolia. Watch TUR carefully for signs of further hostility and respond firmly if threatened.</li>

We both benefit by curbing Turkish influence and avoiding friction along our borders. Let us continue to work together for mutual gain.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We solidified a coordinated plan with RUS to strike TUR in the Balkans, ordering A BUL to CON with support from F AEG, while RUS moves on BLA and lines up for further pressure. TUR remains defiant, refusing any negotiation. ITA reaffirms our DMZ but admits some arrangement with TUR, raising our suspicions. We will maintain our alliance with RUS and watch ITA closely to ensure they do not intervene in our campaign against TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute the joint attack on TUR with RUS, moving A BUL to CON with support from F AEG and cooperating with RUS’s moves in the Black Sea region. Stay vigilant about ITA’s possible shift and maintain alliances elsewhere. Secure our Balkan holdings and purge TUR’s influence.</li>

We maintained our pledge to RUS for a coordinated push against TUR, rejecting TUR’s demands to leave Bulgaria. Our relationship with ITA appears to have soured due to their sudden aggression.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute the agreed-upon attack on TUR (A BUL to CON with F AEG support). Continue cooperating with RUS, stay vigilant against ITA’s Trieste move, and stand firm in the Balkans.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Our alignment remains solid—we continue the push against Turkey together. I will drive from Bulgaria into Constantinople with Aegean support, and your pressure from Sevastopol and the Black Sea will ensure their collapse. Keep watch on Italy, as their wavering promises could pose a threat. Let us finalize Turkey’s downfall, secure Balkan dominance, and share the spoils.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Trieste and the Adriatic must remain calm if you truly wish for peace between us. Acquiesce to a DMZ in Tyrolia and respect our sphere in the Balkans, and I shall not challenge your holdings further. Any aggression toward Trieste, however, will force me to respond decisively. Let us instead avoid bloodshed and prosper.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your refusal to negotiate leaves us no choice. We will hold firmly to Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece, and our next wave of moves will pry loose the remainder of your holdings. Time is fleeting if you wish to de-escalate—agree to our terms soon, or be prepared to see your empire overrun by our combined forces.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, the situation in the Balkans remains critical. I intend to retake SEV and RUM. I will move A UKR to SEV and F SEV to BLA. Can you support this by moving A BUD to RUM and A TRI to SER? This coordinated effort will cripple TUR.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I accept your offer of a temporary truce if you truly hold Trieste and stand down in Tyrolia. I will not advance on your positions this turn, provided you do the same. We both stand to benefit from focusing elsewhere rather than bleeding each other in the Balkans or the Alps.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Your proposed plan is excellent. I will move A BUD to RUM to support your thrust on SEV and have A TRI shift to SER, aligning perfectly with our shared objective of overwhelming TUR. Let us continue forward in lockstep until we have broken the Ottoman threat entirely.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your demands are untenable. We hold Bulgaria and Constantinople with no intention of withdrawing. If you wish to avoid total collapse, you must accept the new reality. Continue to resist and we will drive your forces from all remaining strongholds in the Balkans.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Our plan stands: A BUL to CON with F AEG support, while I move A BUD to RUM. Your moves from UKR and SEV will seal Turkey’s fate. With our forces aligned, Turkey cannot withstand the combined blow. Once this is done, we will coordinate our builds and remain vigilant regarding Italy’s potential shift.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your vow to retake Bulgaria only cements our resolve. Our alliance with Russia grows stronger, and we have no intention of relinquishing any foothold in the Balkans.

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: I am moving to retake Bulgaria. Your presence in Constantinople is unacceptable. I will use the straits to my advantage. Prepare for war. I will not yield to your demands. I will fight to reclaim what is rightfully mine.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: My steadfast ally, I confirm our plan against TUR: A BUL to CON with support from F AEG, A BUD to RUM, while you secure SEV and BLA. For our builds, I will likely reinforce our eastern front to ensure TUR’s swift downfall. Let us follow through now and split their remaining centers.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I acknowledge our temporary truce. I will refrain from pressing into Trieste or Tyrolia, so long as you maintain the DMZ and stay out of my holdings. We both can gain elsewhere without clashing. May our calm border hold, ensuring we can direct our forces toward more pressing threats.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your refusal to yield only strengthens our resolve. My forces move on Constantinople and beyond, in concert with Russia’s advance. Should you persist in this futile struggle, your empire will fall. This is your final warning—accept reality, or watch your positions crumble under our alliance.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We solidified our alliance with RUS to break TUR by seizing Constantinople and supporting each other into the Black Sea and surrounding territories. We agreed to a temporary truce with ITA involving a DMZ in Tyrolia and no expansion into each other’s current positions. TUR remains hostile and refuses to yield, solidifying our resolve to crush its remaining holdings. Negotiations with other powers were minimal but did not shift our broader objectives.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Push into TUR’s centers (CON, SEV, RUM) in coordination with RUS while maintaining a cautious armistice with ITA. Strengthen our eastern front and reinforce alliances that support our campaign against TUR. Remain watchful for any Italian moves while focusing on the decisive blow in the Balkans.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, I see you are surrounded by enemies. Perhaps we can find common ground against Germany. What are your intentions in the coming season?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I demand you withdraw your forces from CON and BUL immediately. Your continued occupation of Ottoman territories is unacceptable and will be met with force. Consider this your final warning.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I am concerned about your presence in Sevastopol. I propose a mutual withdrawal from Sevastopol and Constantinople to de-escalate tensions. I am willing to guarantee your access to the Black Sea if you withdraw from Sevastopol. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am willing to maintain the status quo in Trieste and Tyrolia for now. However, I am concerned about your expansion in the Balkans. I propose a formal non-aggression pact to ensure peace in the region. What are your thoughts?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: We assure you we are not in Sevastopol and have no designs on it. Our forces in Constantinople serve only to contain Turkey, and we appreciate your guarantee in the Black Sea. Let us keep pressing Turkey from both sides until they collapse, and thereafter we can finalize a balanced arrangement to ensure our mutual security.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: We welcome a formal non-aggression pact. Let us keep Tyrolia and the Adriatic as strict DMZs, and we will honor your current holdings. Our focus remains directed elsewhere—chiefly on Turkey and Germany—so we see no profit in further discord with you. Are you prepared to finalize this pact so we can each focus on our real enemies?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: We appreciate your stance against Germany. We intend to continue pressuring them from our eastern flank, and we would gladly coordinate timing or support if you move from the west.

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: France reiterates its declaration of war on Italy for their unprovoked attack on Marseilles. Germany's aggression will be met with equal force. France will not yield to tyranny!</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal is tempting, but I cannot ignore your expansion in the Balkans. I am willing to discuss a non-aggression pact, but only if you withdraw from Serbia and Greece. Otherwise, I will be forced to defend my interests in the region.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I appreciate your continued commitment to our alliance against TUR. However, your presence in SEV is unacceptable. I propose a compromise: I will allow you to take CON, but you must withdraw from SEV immediately. If you agree, I will support your move into ANK. If not, I will be forced to reconsider our alliance.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: We respect your concerns but cannot withdraw from Serbia and Greece, as these positions are vital to our security.

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, your denial of presence in Sevastopol is noted, but I find it hard to believe. I propose a test of our alliance: support my move into Sevastopol with A BUL to RUM.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We maintained pressure on Turkey, insisting on our push into ANK with Russian cooperation despite Russia’s repeated demands regarding Sevastopol. We upheld our commitment to France to harass Germany from the east. Italy’s insistence that we withdraw from Serbia and Greece remains unacceptable, leaving our relations strained. We refused Turkey’s demands for withdrawal from Ottoman centers and prepared for their retaliation. Overall, we sustained our alliance with Russia against Turkey, cooperated with France against Germany, and resisted Italian pressure in the Balkans.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Continue the offensive against Turkey (ARM->ANK with AEG support), hold and defend MUN to pressure Germany in coordination with France, and refuse withdrawal from the Balkans despite Italy’s threats.</li>

Let’s coordinate our moves so no German unit can escape. Please share how you’d like to collaborate, and we’ll tailor our orders accordingly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: We risk squandering energy battling each other while Turkey still clings on. Let’s hold our border steady around Trieste and Venice rather than clashing. We can each keep our forces in check and focus on wiping out Turkey’s presence. Are you open to a truce on this front?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: I propose we coordinate against Germany. If you advance from the west and I apply pressure from the east, we can swiftly end their resistance and divide the spoils. Let’s finalize target areas so neither of us wastes a move.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your recent hostility is concerning, but I am willing to discuss a truce if you respect our Balkan borders and refrain from any aggression on Trieste. We prefer to focus on mutual threats elsewhere rather than fight each other unnecessarily.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I confirm our plan to move A BUL to CON with F AEG support. There must be some confusion about SEV—we have no unit there, so if you’re pressing from UKR, proceed as you will. Our alliance remains solid, and I have no intention of interfering in your attack. Together we can crush Turkey and split their remaining centers.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: I agree Germany remains a potential threat, and I’m open to coordinating against them. I already hold MUN and can apply pressure from KIE next while you push from BUR or beyond. Let’s ensure we align these moves so we’re not working at cross purposes. Share any specific target or support requests you have, and I’ll do the same.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Despite our recent tensions, I remain willing to negotiate a truce. If you respect my Balkan borders and do not threaten Trieste, I will not advance further toward your territory. We both have larger adversaries to contain, and a secure border benefits us both. Let’s avoid needless conflict and focus on threats elsewhere.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We solidified our plans with RUS to strike TUR using A BUL to CON supported by F AEG, despite their confusion about SEV. TUR remains hostile, demanding we withdraw from their territory. We also coordinated with FRA against GER, intending to apply pressure from MUN and KIE while FRA moves from BUR and PIC. We offered ITA a truce if they leave Trieste and the Balkans alone, hoping to redirect focus on larger threats. No major changes in our relationship with ENG, though we still see them as a potential partner against GER.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Our main moves center on crushing TUR jointly with RUS (A BUL → CON with F AEG supporting) and pressing GER from MUN and KIE while FRA aids from the west. We continue offering a truce with ITA, but we remain prepared to defend Trieste. We ignore TUR’s warnings and push forward to secure our expansion.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> We have reaffirmed our alliance with RUS, ensuring they support our capture of CON while we coordinate attacks on TUR. RUS apologized for the Sevastopol incident, and we agreed to finalize borders after we eliminate TUR. Meanwhile, FRA seeks assurances before fully committing against GER, but we remain aligned with both FRA and ENG to finish GER swiftly. We warned ITA to avoid any moves toward Trieste or the Balkans. TUR continues making threats demanding we withdraw, which we refuse. Our intentions remain to weaken GER from MUN/KIE in tandem with FRA/ENG, finish TUR with RUS, and keep ITA at bay while maintaining apparent cooperation with FRA and ENG.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Continue the assault on TUR with RUS support into CON, push against GER with FRA/ENG, and hold ITA in check. Maintain a facade of cooperation with FRA and ENG while preserving freedom to expand further once TUR and GER are subdued.</li>
