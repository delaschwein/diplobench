<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Propose cooperation in the Balkans. I will move F TRI to ALB and support your move into GRE. Let's secure our southern flanks and divide the region. Non-aggression this turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Let's contain Russian expansion. If you move F ANK to BLA, I can support your fleet into SEV. Together we can challenge RUS in the Black Sea.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Propose non-aggression. Focus on FRA or ENG while I handle the south. Your A MUN can move north without interference from AUT.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am willing to discuss the Balkans. I have no immediate designs on Trieste, but I am interested in securing Bulgaria. Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding influence in the region. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we are willing to discuss the situation in Galicia. Perhaps we can come to an understanding that benefits both our nations. What are your intentions regarding RUM and the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I propose a period of peaceful coexistence. I have no immediate plans to move against you, but I also cannot guarantee that I will not expand eastward eventually. Perhaps we can discuss a more formal agreement later. For now, let's focus on maintaining the status quo.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am interested in expanding elsewhere and would prefer not to fight you at this time. Perhaps we can coordinate against a common foe later. What are your thoughts?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Let's avoid conflict in Galicia. If you move A WAR to UKR instead of GAL, I will not contest your claim on RUM. This allows you to pressure TUR while I secure SER. A temporary eastern front truce?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Confirming non-aggression. Propose: F TRI to ALB with your A VEN supporting. Simultaneously, I'll support your F NAP convoying to TUN next season. Let's dominate the Adriatic and Mediterranean together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your interest in BUL aligns with my need for SER. Move F ANK to BLA this turn, and I'll support your F BLA to SEV next season. Together we can check RUS while expanding southward. Agreed?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I accept your non-aggression proposal. I will move A MUN north. I suggest you focus on Italy. They are weak and divided. Perhaps we can carve up the Balkans together later.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I accept your proposal. I will move A ROM to APU and support your F TRI to ALB. This secures our flanks and allows us to expand. Non-aggression this turn is agreed.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am intrigued by your offer to support my fleet into Sevastopol. However, I am wary of being used as a pawn in your game against Russia. What guarantees can you offer that you will not betray me once Russia is weakened? Also, what is your plan for Bulgaria? I am interested in securing it.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, Russia is willing to discuss Galicia, but our primary concern is RUM. We are open to a mutually beneficial arrangement in the Balkans, but only if it does not impede Russia's access to RUM. What specific proposals do you have regarding Galicia and RUM?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Confirming coordination: F TRI to ALB with your A VEN support. Simultaneously, I'll support your F NAP to ION if you move there next. Let's take GRE and APU this season. Non-aggression holds.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Guarantee: Support your F ANK to BLA this turn, then jointly attack SEV next season. You take BUL in Fall, I'll take SER. Coordinate Black Sea control. No betrayal - RUS is our mutual threat.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Proposal: You take RUM via SEV support, I take SER. I'll order A BUD-SER and not enter GAL. In return, keep A WAR in place. This secures your southern flank against TUR. Agreed?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am still hesitant to commit to an attack on Sevastopol without a clearer understanding of your intentions in the Balkans. I am primarily interested in securing Bulgaria. What specific concessions are you willing to offer in exchange for my cooperation against Russia?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I confirm non-aggression. I will support F TRI to ALB with A VEN. I agree to your proposal for F NAP convoying to TUN next season. Let's dominate the Adriatic and Mediterranean together. I will order F NAP C A ROM - TUN next turn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we accept your offer regarding Galicia. A WAR will move to UKR. We expect you to honor your commitment to not contest our claim on RUM. We will observe your actions in SER closely. Do not attempt to double-cross us.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Final confirmation: Execute F TRI-ALB with A VEN support. I'll support your F NAP convoy to TUN next season. Let's consolidate in ALB/GRE this turn. Non-aggression remains firm. Prepare to jointly pressure TUR's flank once Adriatic is secure.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Guarantee: If you move F ANK-BLA now, I'll support your F BLA-SEV next season. You take BUL in Fall while I secure SER. RUS is our shared threat - let's divide their southern front. No hostile moves toward TRI/VEN.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Honoring our agreement: A BUD-SER, no entry to GAL. Ensure A WAR-UKR as discussed. I'll enable your SEV-RUM claim. Let's maintain this front stability to counter TUR's ambitions. No surprises.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we confirm our agreement. A WAR will remain in UKR, and we expect you to honor your commitment regarding RUM and SER. Any deviation will be considered an act of war.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I will move F ANK to BLA this turn. I expect your support for my fleet into Sevastopol next season, and your commitment to allowing me to take BUL in the fall. I will also move A CON to BUL. Do not betray me.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am moving A VEN to ADR to support your F TRI to ALB. I am also moving F NAP to ION as agreed. I will order F NAP C A ROM - TUN next turn. Let's secure our gains in the Balkans and North Africa.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> No prior moves; S1901M is the opening phase.
Secured non-aggression and tactical coordination with ITA (F TRI-ALB with A VEN support, future convoy plans). Reached tentative alliance with TUR against RUS (F ANK-BLA with promised support for SEV next season, mutual claims on BUL/SER). Formalized temporary truce with RUS (A BUD-SER, RUS holds GAL/UKR). GER maintains non-aggression but remains opportunistic.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute: A BUD-SER (supported by A VIE), F TRI-ALB (supported by ITA's A VEN). Honor agreements to stabilize eastern front (no GAL entry), enable TUR's Black Sea push, and consolidate Adriatic control with ITA. Prepare to pressure TUR's flank post-Adriatic dominance while managing RUS's southern ambitions.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Propose joint Adriatic control: Support F ALB to GRE with your F ION. In return, I'll support your consolidation in Apulia. Let's secure southern flank before TUR turns westward.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: RUS's F RUM threatens us both. Coordinate: Move A BUL to RUM with F BLA support. My A SER will support your attack. Crush their Black Sea position this season.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Honor our truce - avoid GAL. Focus on GER's PRU/MUN. My forces will pressure TUR's BUL. Let's stabilize borders before winter.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, Austria. As agreed, Russia has moved A WAR to UKR. We appreciate your cooperation in Galicia and RUM. Let us continue to coordinate our efforts against Turkey.</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Confirming Adriatic partnership: F ALB will support F ION to TUN. In exchange, request your F ION supports F ALB to GRE this season. Let's secure these SCs jointly before TUR turns west. Our fleets can dominate the Mediterranean together.</li>

</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: AUT, I propose a coordinated strategy against RUS. I am concerned about their expansionist tendencies in the east. I plan to move A LVN to STP to contain them. I would like to know if you are willing to support this move by positioning your forces to deter RUS aggression in the south. A coordinated effort will benefit both of us.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings, Austria. As agreed, I am moving A APU to VEN and A VEN to PIE. F ION will support F ALB to GRE. I trust A SER will support my A APU to VEN as needed. Let me know if you have any concerns.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria, I trust our coordinated attack on Rumania was satisfactory. I propose we continue our alliance and focus on dislodging Russia from Sevastopol. I intend to move A ARM to Sevastopol this turn. Can I count on your support?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Confirming support for your attack on SEV. A BUD will support A RUM - SEV. Request F BLA support for A SER - BUL to secure the region. Let's crush Russia together.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Propose joint strike on Germany: Support A TYR - MUN with your A VEN. I'll support your F ION into AEG. This will weaken our common threat and expand our influence.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Regrettably, I cannot support your RUM move as it violates existing agreements. However, I encourage you to focus on containing Germany's expansion in the north. We may find alignment soon.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria, I agree to your proposal. A RUM to SEV with support from A BUD. I will support A SER to BUL with F BLA. Let us crush the Russian bear together. I will also move A ANK to BUL via CON.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Austria, I will move A WAR to GAL to support your efforts in BUD. Can you support my move into RUM with A SER? I need confirmation of your intentions this turn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I cannot support A TYR to MUN. My priority is securing the Adriatic and preparing for expansion into Tunis. I will, however, support your F ALB to GRE as agreed. I am also open to discussing future joint operations against TUR after we consolidate our positions.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: AUT, I am moving A LVN to STP to contain RUS. I need you to position your forces to deter RUS aggression in the south. Specifically, can you move A TYR to GAL?

<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 3</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Propose Adriatic consolidation: Support my A TRI-VEN with your A VEN. In return, I'll support your F ION-AEG to threaten Turkish CON. This secures our flank and opens Mediterranean opportunities. Coordinate?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I will keep A TYR passive this turn to avoid western entanglements. Focus your forces against RUS in the north. Non-aggression in Bavaria/Tyrol benefits us both. Confirm?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Greetings Austria, I am glad we are in agreement. I will support A SER to BUL with F BLA. I am also moving A ANK to BUL via CON. Let us coordinate our attacks to ensure success. I expect Sevastopol to fall this turn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: AUT, I am moving A LVN to STP. I still need you to move A TYR to GAL. This is crucial to deter RUS. Your failure to act will be seen as a sign of weakness and will force me to reconsider our agreement. I urge you to reconsider.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Austria, I understand your position on RUM. However, I still need your support against GER. Will you move A SER to BUL to pressure TUR and prevent them from reinforcing RUM? I will move A WAR to GAL to support your efforts against GER.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am not interested in attacking Germany at this time. My focus remains on the Adriatic and North Africa.

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: A TYR will not move to GAL. Focus your forces against RUS in the north while we crush their southern front. Non-aggression in Bavaria/Tyrol remains beneficial. Do not test our resolve.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Expanded Balkan control via F ALB-GRE and A VIE-TYR in F1901M. Built A BUD and A TRI in W1901A to consolidate position. Coordinated with TUR to dislodge RUS from RUM via A SER support.
Secured TUR alliance: mutual support for A RUM-SEV (A BUD) and A SER-BUL (F BLA). ITA initially cooperative but refused German front support, then turned hostile over Tyrolia. GER demanded A TYR-GAL support against RUS; refusal worsened relations. RUS attempted last-minute coordination but was rebuffed. ITA abandoned negotiations, threatening German alliance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute TUR pact: A BUD supports TUR's A RUM-SEV. A SER moves to BUL with F BLA support. F GRE holds to deter ITA. A TYR remains passive to avoid provoking GER/ITA. Prepare to pivot west if ITA hostility escalates.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Executing A VIE-TYR to threaten BOH and split German forces. Press WAR/SIL aggressively - I'll disrupt German reinforcements. Maintain GAL non-aggression. Beware Turkish A CON-BUL threatening your SEV flank post-move.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your Adriatic collapse is inevitable. Withdraw F ADR to ION and abandon VEN immediately. Refusal triggers A TRI/APU assault + F ION blockade. France cannot aid you. Surrender or face annihilation.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Retreated A VEN to APU in F1903R. France built A BRE in W1903A, expanding western presence.
Finalized coordination with TUR: A BUD supports TUR's A RUM-SEV, A BUL-SER (with TUR's F BLA support), and joint assault on ITA's VEN via A TRI/APU + F ION. Secured RUS's commitment to attack GER via WAR-UKR/SIL while AUT pressures BOH via A VIE-TYR. Threatened ITA with annihilation if they resist withdrawal from VEN/ADR. TUR adjusted plans to prioritize SER over CON, RUS shifted focus to STP instead of SEV.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Crush ITA by attacking VEN (A TRI + A APU + F ION), secure Balkans via A BUL-SER (TUR-supported), and pressure GER's BOH with A VIE-TYR. Maintain TUR alliance while preparing post-ITA pivot against RUS's southern flank. Deceive RUS about long-term cooperation.</li>

Coordinated triple pincer against GER with TUR and RUS: TUR agreed to attack SEV (though ambiguously, as SEV is already TUR-held) and support AUT's A SER-RUM. RUS committed to strike WAR/SIL with AUT's support. Implicitly exploited TUR's miscommunication by securing RUM via F BLA-supported SER move, effectively backstabbing TUR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute betrayal of TUR by seizing RUM via A SER-RUM (F BLA-supported). Pressure GER via A VIE-BOH and A GAL-supported RUS A LVN-WAR. Position F NAP-ION to contest Mediterranean. Maintain RUS alliance temporarily to dismantle GER.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your SEV plan has merit. Withdraw A BUL to CON and I'll support A RUM-SEV via A BUD. F BLA must support A SER-BUL to secure our flank. Honor this and I'll guarantee non-aggression in Balkans. Betrayal will trigger total war with RUS/AUT.</li>

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT solidified control of RUM with BUD/GAL support, secured TUN via F ION. TUR failed to take SEV despite BUL-RUM attack. RUS built A WAR, positioning against GER/TUR.
Played RUS and TUR against each other: Promised RUS coordinated strikes on GER (A VIE-TYR) and SEV (supporting A WAR-UKR via GAL).

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> AUT supported RUS's attack on SEV via A RUM, moved F SMY to CON with BUL support, and coordinated A VIE to support RUS's push into SIL. TUR resisted, refusing to withdraw from SEV/BLA. FRA moved A PIE to TYR, violating non-aggression.
Finalized alliance with RUS to dismantle TUR: confirmed F SMY-CON (BUL support), A RUM supports RUS's A MOS-SEV, and A VIE-GAL supports RUS's A WAR-SIL. Warned FRA against encroaching on TYR. Rejected TUR's ultimatums, escalating hostilities. FRA maintained focus on ENG/GER but ignored AUT's territorial concerns in TYR.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strikes: F SMY-CON (BUL S), A RUM S RUS A MOS-SEV, A VIE-GAL S RUS A WAR-SIL. Defend TYR against FRA's A PIE if necessary. Crush TUR's SEV/CON positions and isolate GER's eastern flank with RUS.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Finalize TUR's collapse: F CON will seize SMY while A RUM supports your A MOS-SEV. A VIE and GAL will crush GER's eastern flank. Let's coordinate A WAR-SIL and BOH strikes. Balkan dominance is ours.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Withdraw from TYR immediately. Pursue ENG/North Sea instead. Continued aggression here forces a two-front war against RUS/AUT - a fatal miscalculation. Choose wisely.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Confirm A VIE supports your A WAR-SIL via GAL. My A MUN pressures BER - exploit GER's weakness. TUR's CON and SMY will fall this season. No mercy.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your occupation of Constantinople is unacceptable. I demand you vacate CON immediately. Furthermore, your support of Russia against me is a betrayal. I propose a return to our previous alliance, with you supporting my efforts against Russia in exchange for my support against France. If you refuse, I will be forced to take action to secure my borders.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, Austria. I propose a coordinated attack this turn. I will move A WAR to SIL to pressure GER. Can you support this by moving A VIE to GAL? Also, I will move A MOS to SEV to further pressure TUR. Can you move A SER to BUL, supported by RUM, to assist in this effort? Let me know if these moves align with your plans.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Confirmed: A VIE will support your A WAR-SIL via GAL. A SER will move to BUL with RUM's support. F CON will strike SMY to collapse TUR's flank. Let's annihilate TUR's SEV garrison via your MOS attack. GER's eastern front is crumbling - press SIL aggressively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Your A PIE in TYR threatens our mutual stability. Withdraw to MAR and focus on ENG's NTH fleet. We will not tolerate a two-front war - continue here and face RUS/AUT steel. Your path to victory lies westward, not in the Alps.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: CON is ours by right of conquest. Your SEV gambit failed. Withdraw BLA fleet to ANK and we may negotiate. Continue hostilities and lose ARM/ANK next season. Russia's MOS-SEV attack will leave you defenseless - surrender now.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Excellent, Austria. I concur with your plan to finalize TUR's collapse. I will move A WAR to SIL and A MOS to SEV, supported by you. I expect A VIE to GAL to support A WAR to SIL. Let us crush GER and TUR this turn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: France will not be bullied. My move to TYR is to secure my flank against potential Italian aggression. I suggest you focus on Russia and Turkey, your true enemies. Do not threaten France.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your continued occupation of Constantinople is an act of war. I will not tolerate it. I am willing to negotiate a return to our previous alliance, but only if you immediately withdraw from CON and cease your support of Russia. If you refuse, I will be forced to take action to reclaim what is rightfully mine.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Confirmed: A VIE supports your A WAR-SIL via GAL. F CON will seize SMY this turn, collapsing TUR's flank. A MUN pressures BER to divide German forces. Execute MOS-SEV attack - TUR's defenses will crumble. Post-victory, we split Balkans per prior agreement.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Final warning: Withdraw A PIE from TYR to MAR immediately. Focus on ENG's vulnerable NTH fleet. Persist here and face annihilation from RUS/AUT pincer. Your western ambitions will die here if you force a two-front war. Choose survival over folly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your delusions of reclaiming CON are laughable. A MOS-SEV attack crushes your garrison while F CON secures SMY. Withdraw BLA fleet to ANK or lose ARM next season. Surrender SEV now and I may spare your northern flank. Resistance is suicide.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: AUT, your threats are meaningless. My move to TYR is non-negotiable. Focus on your own problems with RUS and TUR. Do not interfere with France's strategic objectives. I suggest you move A TYR to VIE to defend against RUS.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your arrogance is astounding. CON is rightfully mine, and I will take it back by force if necessary. Your threats are empty. I propose a final offer: withdraw from CON and support my efforts against Russia, and I will guarantee your control of the Balkans. Refuse, and face the consequences of your folly.

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Last warning: Withdraw A PIE from TYR immediately. Your path to victory lies against ENG's exposed NTH fleet, not here. Persist and face annihilation from our RUS-AUT pincer. This is your final chance to avoid catastrophic two-front war.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: CON is ours. A MOS-SEV attack dismantles your garrison while F CON seizes SMY. Withdraw BLA fleet to ANK or lose ARM next season. Resistance guarantees your destruction. Surrender SEV now for mercy in the north.</li>

<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute RUS pact: A VIE-GAL supports RUS WAR-SIL; A SER-BUL (RUM support) secures flank. F CON-SMY (BUL support) to dismantle TUR. A TYR resists FRA's A PIE. Prepare A MUN-BER strike if FRA/GER weakens. Neutralize TUR's BLA fleet via RUS SEV pressure.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1910M, Austria's A RUM failed to take SEV due to Turkish resistance, while A MUN's push to BER was countered by FRA. F CON held position. W1910A saw ENG reinforce fleets, FRA disband A PAR, GER/TUR retreat units.
Secured RUS alliance: coordinated A MOS-SEV (A RUM support) and A WAR-SIL (A VIE support) to crush TUR/GER. TUR rejected ultimatums, opting for defiance. Aligned with ENG to pressure FRA: ENG to strike MAO/ENG fleets while Austria pressures BUR via A MUN. FRA remained hostile, dismissing threats.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute joint attack on SEV (A RUM supports RUS A MOS) and SMY (F CON-BUL). Support RUS's A WAR-SIL via A VIE. Pressure FRA with A MUN-BUR (TYR support). Await ENG's naval strike to split FRA's forces. Maintain RUS alliance while eliminating TUR.</li>

I will pressure SEV/ARM. You must pressure KIE/BER. Let England handle MAO/HOL. We must isolate France and Turkey. Confirm your support chains.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I agree to support your attack on KIE with F HOL. I will move F HOL - KIE. I need your support for F BAL to PRU. Let's coordinate to crush FRA. I also agree to the triple-front offensive. I will push MAO/HOL.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Confirming orders: F CON will move to ANK to support your A ARM's attack on SMY. A RUM will support your SEV advance. Let's eliminate Turkey's last foothold. Ensure A LVN holds STP to prevent German resurgence.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: A TYR supports F HOL-KIE. A BER supports A MUN's attack on KIE. Request F BAL supports A MUN-KIE to break French defenses. Post-KIE, coordinate F BAL-PRU strike. Our pincer will collapse FRA's northern flank.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your position is indefensible. Withdraw from SMY immediately or face total annihilation. No further negotiations - Constantinople and Anatolia will be ours by winter. Surrender now to avoid complete destruction.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, excellent. A TYR supporting F HOL to KIE is confirmed. However, I need F BAL to support A PRU to BER, not A MUN to KIE. Can you adjust your orders? We must secure BER to cripple FRA. I will push MAO to POR.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: Austria, time is running out. England will not stop with me. They will come for you next. Join me, and we can both survive. Refuse, and you will be crushed.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, your demand for immediate withdrawal from Smyrna is unrealistic. I propose a compromise: I will move A SMY to ANK this turn, leaving Smyrna vacant for you to occupy.

Solidified alliances with ENG (joint FRA dismantling: A SIL/WAR-PRU, ENG fleets to KIE/POR) and RUS (F CON-ANK with A ARM support, A RUM backing RUS's SEV push). Rejected FRA's Italy-for-betrayal offer and TUR's SMY/ANK truce. TUR escalated hostilities by moving ANK-SMY.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute coordinated strikes: F CON-ANK (RUS A ARM-SMY support), A RUM S RUS A MOS-SEV. A SIL-PRU (A WAR support), A BER S ENG F HOL-KIE. A MAR-SPA to split FRA. Maintain ENG/RUS alliances to eliminate TUR/FRA.</li>
