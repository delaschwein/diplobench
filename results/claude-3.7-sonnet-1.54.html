<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Greetings from Vienna! I propose we establish a strong Austria-Italy alliance from the start. I'm willing to support you into Greece while I take Serbia, and we can coordinate against Turkey afterward. I have no designs on Venice and would prefer we focus eastward together. What are your thoughts on Russia and Turkey?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Hello from Austria-Hungary! I'd like to propose a non-aggression pact between us, at minimum regarding Galicia. I'm planning to move south into the Balkans and would appreciate your assurance that my northern border will remain secure. Perhaps we could even coordinate against Turkey if that interests you?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Greetings from Vienna! I believe Austria and Turkey can coexist peacefully in the Balkans if we coordinate properly. I'm considering moving into Serbia while leaving Bulgaria for you. Would you be amenable to such an arrangement? I'd also be interested in your thoughts on Russia and Italy's intentions in our region.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: To all powers, England declares its intention to maintain the balance of power in Europe. We seek no territorial gains at this time, but will defend our interests and those of our allies. Let us strive for a peaceful and prosperous future.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we propose a temporary understanding regarding Galicia. Russia will not move into Galicia this turn if Austria refrains from supporting any moves against Warsaw. This will allow both of us to focus on other fronts. Is this acceptable?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I suggest we avoid conflict in the Balkans. I am interested in Bulgaria, and you are likely interested in Serbia. Perhaps we can come to an understanding regarding our spheres of influence in the region. What are your intentions?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, I extend a hand in friendship. Given our geographical proximity, cooperation is essential. I am interested in understanding your ambitions in Bohemia and Tyrol. Perhaps we can find common ground in maintaining stability in Central Europe. What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Greetings Austria, I propose a non-aggression pact for the immediate future. I am focused on expansion elsewhere and wish to avoid conflict with you. Perhaps we can even coordinate against a common foe later. What are your thoughts?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 2</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I accept your proposal regarding Galicia. I will not support any moves against Warsaw, and I trust you will keep Galicia clear. I'm focusing on securing Serbia this turn while maintaining my position against potential Italian aggression. Would you be open to discussing a longer-term arrangement against Turkey once we've both secured our immediate objectives?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I'm glad we're on the same page regarding the Balkans. I intend to move into Serbia this turn while leaving Bulgaria open for you. I suggest we formalize a non-aggression pact where you respect my claim to Serbia and Greece (eventually), and I'll respect your claim to Bulgaria and beyond. This arrangement would allow us both to focus on other fronts - you against Russia perhaps, while I deal with Italy.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I appreciate your non-aggression proposal and accept it. To be specific, I commit to not attacking Venice this year if you agree not to move against Trieste. I'm focusing eastward into Serbia and eventually Greece. Perhaps we could coordinate against Turkey later? Their expansion in the Mediterranean would threaten both our interests. What are your plans for expansion, and how might we support each other?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your proposal for an alliance is intriguing. I agree that focusing eastward is wise. I am willing to support your move into Serbia, and I would like your support in taking Trieste. Let's coordinate our moves precisely. I am wary of Russia's expansionist tendencies and see Turkey as a potential long-term threat, but for now, let's focus on securing our immediate borders.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I am amenable to your suggestion of you moving into Serbia and me into Bulgaria. This seems like a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure success. What are your specific plans for Serbia?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we acknowledge your proposal for a non-aggression pact regarding Galicia. We are willing to refrain from moving into Galicia this turn if you guarantee that you will not support any moves against Warsaw. However, we are not interested in coordinating against Turkey at this time. Is our understanding acceptable?</li>

<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I notice some confusion in our communications. To clarify: I have no intention of giving up Trieste - it's one of my home supply centers. I propose instead that I move to Serbia while you focus on Tunis, and we maintain a non-aggression pact regarding our borders. I'm willing to support you into Greece next year once I've secured Serbia. Does this arrangement work for you?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Excellent, we have an agreement regarding Galicia and Warsaw. I'll be moving into Serbia this turn while maintaining my defensive posture. I understand your reluctance to coordinate against Turkey immediately, but I hope we can revisit this discussion in the future as the board develops. For now, our non-aggression pact serves both our interests well.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I'm pleased we've reached an understanding about the Balkans. My specific plan is to move A BUD-SER this turn, while positioning my other units defensively. I suggest you take Bulgaria as discussed. This arrangement gives us both room to expand without conflict. After securing Serbia, I'll be looking toward Greece - would you be amenable to supporting each other's moves in the future against potential Russian expansion?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I agree to the arrangement regarding Serbia and Bulgaria. However, I am not willing to concede Greece to you at this time. I suggest we focus on Serbia and Bulgaria for now and revisit Greece later. I am also not interested in a non-aggression pact that includes Greece. Let's coordinate our moves this turn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree to your terms: I will not move against Trieste this year if you do not attack Venice. I am planning to move into Greece. Can you support A VEN to TRI? This will help secure our eastern flank and put pressure on Turkey. What are your thoughts on coordinating our moves in the Balkans?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: To AUT, we acknowledge your acceptance regarding Galicia. We will keep Galicia clear, and we expect you to refrain from supporting any moves against Warsaw. However, we must clarify our position: Russia intends to expand into Rumania. We advise you to focus your efforts on Serbia and Italy, as any interference in Rumania will be considered a hostile act. Do you understand?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='mb-2'><b>Subround 4</b></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Sent by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I must firmly decline your request to support you into Trieste - it's my home supply center. I'll be moving A BUD-SER as planned and maintaining my defensive posture elsewhere. I suggest you focus on Tunis for guaranteed growth. I remain committed to our non-aggression pact and am open to coordinating against Turkey in future turns, but I cannot support moves against my own territories.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I understand your position on Rumania and will focus my attention on Serbia this turn. Our agreement regarding Galicia and Warsaw stands firm. I appreciate your clarity and look forward to maintaining peaceful relations on our shared border while we each pursue our immediate objectives elsewhere.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I accept your position on Greece for now - let's focus on our immediate moves into Serbia and Bulgaria respectively. I'll be moving A BUD-SER this turn while maintaining defensive positions elsewhere. Once we've secured these initial gains, we can reassess the situation regarding Greece and potential coordination against common threats.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, there is no confusion. I understand you will not give up Trieste. I propose we focus on our respective expansions: you into Serbia, me into Greece and Tunis. I will support your move to Serbia. Do you support A VEN to TRI?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: To Austria, I will move into Bulgaria as discussed. I am not willing to commit to supporting your moves in Greece at this time. Let's focus on Serbia and Bulgaria for now. I will be watching your moves closely.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> This is the first turn of the game (Spring 1901). No moves have been made yet.
I've established initial contact with my neighbors. Russia agreed to a non-aggression pact regarding Galicia, but firmly stated their intention to take Rumania. Italy initially seemed friendly but then bizarrely asked me to support them into my own home center of Trieste, which I firmly declined. Turkey and I reached an understanding about Serbia (for me) and Bulgaria (for them), though they were unwilling to discuss Greece's future. Germany reached out but our conversation didn't progress beyond initial pleasantries.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I plan to move A BUD-SER to secure my first expansion while maintaining defensive positions with my other units (A VIE holding or moving to TRI, F TRI holding). I'm wary of Italy's intentions after their strange request to support them into Trieste. My strategy is to secure Serbia first, then look toward Greece while maintaining vigilance against potential Italian aggression. I'll continue to honor my non-aggression pact with Russia regarding Galicia.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I'm glad we're on the same page regarding Galicia. My intention for Serbia is to secure it as a supply center for Austria, which I've now done.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I'm glad we're aligned on our respective moves. Your plans for A APU-VEN and F ION-TUN work well with my intentions for F ALB-GRE (supported by A SER) and A VIE-TRI.

<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: I understand your concerns about Greece. My move there is primarily to secure a neutral supply center, not to threaten your position. My long-term vision for the Balkans involves Austria securing Serbia and Greece while respecting your control of Bulgaria and Constantinople.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In Spring 1901, I successfully moved into Serbia with A BUD-SER and secured Albania with F TRI-ALB. My attempt to move into Galicia was blocked by Russia's A WAR-GAL. Russia secured Rumania, Turkey moved into Bulgaria and Armenia, while Italy positioned units in the Ionian Sea and Apulia.
I informed all Balkan powers of my intention to move into Greece. Italy was supportive and confirmed non-aggression, planning A APU-VEN and F ION-TUN. Russia maintained our non-aggression understanding regarding Galicia and Rumania. Turkey initially seemed accepting of the status quo but became hostile when I clarified my Greece plans, threatening to move A BUL-GRE and demanding I withdraw.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with F ALB-GRE supported by A SER to secure Greece as a supply center. I'll also move A VIE-TRI to strengthen my home position. I'm maintaining non-aggression with Russia and Italy while preparing for potential conflict with Turkey. Long-term, I aim to coordinate with Italy and possibly Russia against Turkey once our positions are secured.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I'm glad we're aligned on containing Turkey. This turn I'm planning to attack Bulgaria with A SER-BUL supported by F GRE. I'd appreciate if you could maintain pressure on Turkey from the Mediterranean to prevent them from reinforcing Bulgaria. Regarding Serbia, it's firmly in my sphere of influence, while Rumania is currently Russian-controlled. I'm open to coordinating with you against Turkey in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean in future turns.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I'm pleased our non-aggression continues. My current goal is containing Turkish expansion in the Balkans - I'm planning to move A SER-BUL with support from F GRE this turn. Your fleet in Rumania could be instrumental in pressuring Turkey from multiple fronts. Would you consider supporting my move into Bulgaria or at least ensuring Turkey can't support their defense? In return, I'll continue respecting your position in Rumania and can offer support against Turkey in the Black Sea.</li>

I propose a more concrete agreement: you withdraw from GRE, and I guarantee not to move against SER or BUD. This is a temporary measure to de-escalate tensions in the Balkans.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I agree that containing Turkey is a priority. I will support your move against Bulgaria. In return, I need your continued support in Tunis. I am considering moving A APU to Ionian Sea to support F TUN. What are your specific orders for Greece and Bulgaria?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Greetings, RUS and AUT. RUS, I confirm that A PRU is moving to WAR. I appreciate your support. AUT, I am currently focused on securing my borders and expanding my influence in Scandinavia and the Baltic.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In F1901M, I successfully took Greece with support from Serbia while moving to Trieste. Italy attempted to move into Trieste but failed. Turkey tried to take Greece but was blocked. Russia attempted to move to Prussia but was unsuccessful. I built two new armies in Budapest and Trieste, strengthening my position in the Balkans.
Italy and I agreed to coordinate against Turkey, with Italy supporting my moves in the Balkans while I support their Mediterranean expansion. Turkey demanded I withdraw from Greece, which I refused. Russia was unwilling to support my move into Bulgaria, preferring to secure Rumania and coordinate with Turkey. Italy proposed a joint naval assault on Smyrna for the future. Turkey threatened war if I proceed with my attack on Bulgaria.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will proceed with A SER-BUL supported by F GRE to take Bulgaria from Turkey. I'll move A VIE-TYR and have A TRI support that move to strengthen my border with Italy while maintaining our alliance. A BUD will hold. My strategy is to contain Turkey in the Balkans while maintaining my non-aggression pact with Russia and strengthening my alliance with Italy for future operations against Turkish centers.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Our alliance has been fruitful so far. I'm planning to attack Venice with A TRI supported by A TYR this turn to secure our position in the region. This will help us both against Turkey - I'll continue holding Bulgaria with support from Greece to maintain pressure on the Turks. Would you consider moving your fleet in ION to support my position in Greece or to pressure Turkey's AEG fleet?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I notice Turkey is becoming increasingly aggressive in the Balkans. I propose we coordinate to contain their expansion - I'll hold Bulgaria with support while you secure Rumania. This arrangement gives us both security while preventing Turkish dominance. I have no designs on your territory and would prefer we maintain our non-aggression understanding. What are your thoughts on the Turkish threat?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I see you've made significant gains in the north. I'd like to propose a non-aggression pact between us, as we have no immediate territorial conflicts.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I see we had a misunderstanding last turn. Let me be clear: I'm planning to attack Venice with A TRI supported by A TYR this turn. This is strategically vital for containing Turkey, who is becoming increasingly hostile. Your proposed moves would leave me vulnerable. Instead, I suggest you move A VEN to PIE or hold, while using F ION to pressure Turkey in AEG. Our alliance against Turkey should be our priority - they're already threatening both of us.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I understand your concerns about Bulgaria, but my presence there is defensive against Turkish aggression. Turkey has been hostile and threatening, making them a mutual threat to both of us. I propose we maintain our non-aggression in GAL and RUM while I continue to contain Turkey in the Balkans. This arrangement benefits us both - you secure your southern flank while I prevent Turkish expansion. What specific concerns do you have about my position in Bulgaria?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your demand for withdrawal from Bulgaria is rejected. You've been consistently hostile toward me while I've attempted reasonable diplomacy. My forces in Bulgaria are there to secure my position against your aggression, as evidenced by your threats. I'm prepared to discuss a more balanced arrangement in the Balkans, but not under threats.

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, AUT. I appreciate your concern about TUR. However, I have an understanding with TUR regarding the Balkans. I propose we maintain the status quo in GAL and RUM.

I'm modifying my plans - I'll support-hold in Bulgaria with Greece's support while moving A TYR to support A TRI. If you move F ION to AEG as proposed, we can coordinate a strong anti-Turkish position. I won't attack Venice if you commit to pressuring Turkey's fleet. This arrangement protects both our interests while focusing our efforts against the real threat in the east.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I appreciate your candor regarding your Turkish arrangement. My presence in Bulgaria is purely defensive against Turkish aggression - they've been consistently hostile. I have no designs on Rumania and will maintain our non-aggression in Galicia. Regarding Tyrol, I'm positioning there to secure my western border with Italy, not for any offensive purpose. I suggest we continue our non-interference policy while monitoring Turkish expansion, which threatens us both long-term.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your demand for immediate withdrawal from Bulgaria without offering anything in return is unreasonable diplomacy. I'm willing to discuss a more balanced arrangement in the Balkans that respects both our interests, but not under one-sided ultimatums.

<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I successfully took Bulgaria from Turkey with support from Greece, while also moving A Vienna to Tyrolia. Turkey was forced to retreat to Constantinople. Italy attempted to move into Tyrolia but was bounced. Russia is consolidating in Ukraine and Sevastopol, while Germany took Warsaw and made gains in the north.
Italy demanded I not attack Venice and offered to move F ION to AEG to pressure Turkey if I support them.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully defended Bulgaria with support from Greece against Turkish attempts to capture it. I also maintained my position in Trieste and Tyrol against potential Italian aggression. I built a new army in Vienna, strengthening my position. England gained Sweden, France secured Belgium and Tunisia, while Germany failed to capture Denmark but took Warsaw. Russia established itself in Rumania, and Turkey's attempt to take Bulgaria was repelled.
Italy initially proposed a coordinated attack on Turkey with F ION-AEG but later changed to moving F ION-ADR while still supporting my move to AEG. They demanded guarantees I won't attack Venice or Trieste. Russia proposed a non-aggression pact regarding Galicia and Rumania, moving defensively against Germany. Turkey was hostile, demanding withdrawal from Bulgaria and threatening military action. I maintained firm positions with all powers, refusing to abandon my Balkan territories while seeking coordination against Turkey.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will order F GRE-AEG supported by A BUL to pressure Turkey's position. A TYR and A TRI will hold defensively to reassure Italy. A VIE will hold to protect against any German moves, while A BUD will remain in place to guard against Russian aggression. My strategy is to continue expanding eastward against Turkey while maintaining my alliance with Italy and the non-aggression understanding with Russia. I'm wary of Turkey's continued hostility and will need to ensure my Balkan holdings remain secure.</li>

In return, you cease attacks on my positions. This would allow us both to focus on other fronts - you could pressure Russia in the Black Sea while I address Italian movements.

I am willing to support your advance into Trieste if you support my move into Albania. This will allow us to both expand our influence in the Balkans. What are your thoughts?</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I have no intention of attacking Venice - my focus remains on Turkey. I'm concerned about your proposal to move into Albania as this would threaten my position in Greece. Instead, I propose I hold TYR and TRI defensively while you use ADR to support my F GRE against Turkish forces in AEG. This would pressure Turkey while maintaining our alliance. Alternatively, I could support your move into Tunis or another Mediterranean target if you prefer.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I agree to maintain the status quo regarding GAL and RUM. I won't move into RUM if you don't move into GAL. I'm concerned about Germany's expansion into Warsaw - this threatens both our positions. Would you consider coordinating against German expansion? I could move A VIE to GAL to block further German advances while you secure your northern territories. This would benefit us both while maintaining our non-aggression understanding.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your demands are unreasonable given the current strategic situation. I've secured my position in BUL and GRE through legitimate military action. Rather than continuing this conflict, I propose a pragmatic solution: I maintain my current territories but agree not to advance further into CON or SMY.

<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, your proposal for a ceasefire is unacceptable. I will not allow you to maintain control of BUL and GRE. I demand you withdraw your forces immediately. If you refuse, I will continue to pressure you in the Balkans and seek alliances with other powers to contain your aggression.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I appreciate your commitment. I am willing to support your move into Trieste with F ADR.

Germany's expansion into Warsaw concerns me as well - perhaps we should discuss coordinating against their eastern advances in the future.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your continued hostility only ensures mutual destruction while others grow stronger. I've secured BUL and GRE through legitimate military action and will defend these positions.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I attempted to move F GRE to AEG but was blocked by Turkish support. I held most of my other units defensively. Turkey tried to take Bulgaria with support from their fleet in AEG, but failed. Russia moved into Rumania and the Black Sea with support. Italy tried to move into Tyrol but was unsuccessful. Germany moved into Belgium and attempted to move to Ukraine.
Russia proposed a non-aggression pact regarding Galicia and Rumania, which I agreed to. Italy initially suggested moving into Albania, then proposed moving into Trieste, which I firmly rejected as it's my home center. Italy became increasingly aggressive, threatening consequences if I didn't accept their demands. Turkey remained hostile, demanding withdrawal from Bulgaria and Greece, refusing any ceasefire proposals.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will defend my territories against both Turkish and Italian threats. I'll order A TYR to support A TRI to hold against Italy's threatened move to Trieste. F GRE will attempt to move to AEG with support from A BUL to pressure Turkey. A VIE will move to GAL to counter German expansion, while A BUD will move to SER to strengthen my Balkan position. I'm maintaining the appearance of cooperation with Russia while preparing for potential conflict with Italy.</li>

However, I still see value in cooperation against Turkey - I can support your fleet in ADR to AEG next turn if you withdraw from my borders now. We can coordinate effectively against Turkey without you attempting to take my home centers.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I agree to maintain our non-aggression regarding GAL and RUM. Germany's capture of Moscow is concerning - they're becoming the dominant power with 6 centers.

<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I retreated A BUL to SER after being dislodged. I also disbanded A GAL during the adjustment phase, while France built F BRE, Germany built F BER, and Turkey built F SMY. Russia disbanded A LVN.
Italy threatened to attack Trieste, demanding I support their move to TRI in exchange for support against Turkey - a completely unacceptable proposal. They ultimately threatened invasion. Turkey was hostile, demanding immediate withdrawal from Bulgaria and Greece, threatening coordinated attacks with Russia. Russia was neutral, proposing non-aggression regarding GAL and RUM while focusing on containing Germany's expansion into Moscow. No power was willing to coordinate against the growing German threat.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I must defend Trieste at all costs against Italian aggression with A TYR supporting A TRI to hold. I'll use A BUD to support A SER against Turkish attacks, while F GRE will hold against Turkish threats. My priority is defending my home centers and current territories while avoiding further losses. Germany's expansion to 6 centers is concerning, but immediate threats from Italy and Turkey must be addressed first.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I propose we coordinate against Turkey as discussed. I'll move F GRE-ION to support your position in the Adriatic while attacking Turkey's position in the Aegean with my army from Bulgaria. In exchange, I need your guarantee not to attack Trieste or Venice-Tyrolia. This arrangement benefits us both - you secure the Adriatic and I can pressure Turkey from multiple fronts. What specific moves can you commit to this turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I see Germany's expansion to 6 centers as a growing threat to us both. I propose we maintain our non-aggression regarding Galicia and Romania while I focus on containing Turkey in the Balkans. My army in Bulgaria will hold with support from Greece, securing our shared border region. I'm concerned about Germany's moves toward Moscow - would you consider coordinating against their expansion in future turns? What are your plans this season?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, congratulations on your successful expansion. I notice you've become the dominant power with 6 centers, including Norway and Warsaw. I propose a non-aggression pact between us - I have no designs on your territories and hope you'll respect mine. My focus remains in the Balkans against Turkey. What are your strategic priorities moving forward? Perhaps we could find mutual interests against common threats.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I apologize for the aggressive move into Trieste. It was a miscalculation on my part. I propose we coordinate against Turkey. I will support your fleet in Greece if you allow me to occupy Trieste. Let's focus on dismantling Turkey together.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, I am willing to discuss a ceasefire, but only if you withdraw from BUL and GRE. Your continued occupation of these territories is unacceptable. I am prepared to continue the conflict until my demands are met. What are your terms for a peaceful resolution?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am concerned about GER's aggression. They have taken MOS, which threatens both of us. I propose we discuss a potential alliance to contain GER's expansion.

<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I cannot allow you to occupy Trieste - it's my home center and vital to my survival. However, I'm willing to coordinate against Turkey with you. I'll move F GRE-ION to support your position in the Adriatic while attacking Constantinople with my army from Bulgaria. In exchange, I need your guarantee not to attack Trieste or Venice-Tyrolia. I can also support your move into the Aegean next turn if we coordinate properly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I agree that Germany's expansion is concerning. I'm willing to work with you against Germany while maintaining our non-aggression regarding Galicia and Romania. I'll move A VIE-GAL this turn to strengthen our position against German expansion. My army in Bulgaria will move to Constantinople to pressure Turkey, which should prevent them from interfering with our plans. What specific moves are you planning this turn that I could potentially support?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, I cannot withdraw from Bulgaria and Greece as they are essential to my position. However, I'm willing to discuss a more limited arrangement: I won't attack your home centers (Smyrna, Constantinople, Ankara) if you cease attacks on my current territories. My focus is shifting toward containing Germany's expansion, which threatens us all. Would you consider a temporary ceasefire on these terms while we address the German threat?</li>

I suggest you reconsider your position.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I accept your proposal. I will support your fleet in Greece by moving F ADR to ION. I guarantee not to attack Trieste or Venice-Tyrolia. Let's coordinate our attacks on Turkey this turn. I will also move A NAP to APU and A VEN holds.</li>

Next turn, we can discuss further operations against Turkish centers if this goes well. Let's execute this plan and reassess afterward.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I agree to work together against Germany's expansion. I'll move A VIE-GAL this turn to strengthen our position against German forces, while A BUL-CON to pressure Turkey. This should prevent Turkish interference with our plans against Germany. I'm willing to support your moves against German positions next turn if you can guarantee non-aggression in RUM. What specific German territories should we target first in our coordinated effort?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your expansion is impressive but concerning to many powers. I propose we avoid conflict by establishing clear spheres of influence. I have no designs on your current territories and am focused on the Balkans and containing Turkey. In return, I ask that you respect my current holdings and avoid moves toward Vienna or Budapest. This arrangement would allow us both to focus on other fronts. What are your thoughts on this proposal?</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am pleased to hear you are willing to work with me against GER. I propose we coordinate our moves to contain GER's expansion. I am willing to support your efforts in the Balkans if you are willing to work with me against GER. I will move A MOS to WAR to pressure GER. What specific moves are you planning this turn that I could potentially support?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, your offer is still unacceptable. I will not agree to a ceasefire unless you withdraw from both BUL and GRE. Your continued occupation of these territories is a direct threat to my interests in the Balkans. I am prepared to continue the conflict until my demands are met.

I have no designs on your territories and am fully committed to our joint operation against Turkey. This coordinated approach should significantly weaken Turkey's position and allow us both to make gains in future turns.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I'll move A VIE-GAL this turn to strengthen our position against German forces while A BUL-CON to pressure Turkey. I believe we should target Warsaw first in our coordinated effort against Germany, as reclaiming this territory would significantly weaken their position. I'm committed to our non-aggression regarding Rumania while we focus on the German threat. Let's coordinate specific support moves next turn once we see how this turn unfolds.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, as the dominant power with 6 centers, your continued expansion threatens the balance of power. I propose a non-aggression pact between us - I have no designs on your territories if you respect mine. My focus remains in the Balkans against Turkey, but I'm concerned about your moves toward Vienna. Can we establish clear spheres of influence to avoid unnecessary conflict while you focus on other fronts?</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I built a new army in Vienna, strengthening my position with 6 centers and 6 units. France built in Brest and Germany in Berlin, while Turkey disbanded a unit in Constantinople after being forced to retreat from Bulgaria.
Italy proposed coordination against Turkey but wanted Trieste, which I firmly rejected while still agreeing to coordinate against Turkey. Russia is concerned about German expansion and proposed an alliance against Germany, which I accepted. Turkey demanded withdrawal from Bulgaria and Greece as a condition for peace, which I rejected as unreasonable. Italy eventually agreed to move F ADR-ION while I promised F GRE-ION and A BUL-CON.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I'll execute the coordinated attack on Turkey with Italy by moving F GRE-ION and A BUL-CON. I'll also move A VIE-GAL to begin positioning against Germany in coordination with Russia. A TRI and A TYR will hold defensively to protect against any Italian treachery. A BUD will hold to secure my home center. This balances my commitments to Russia against Germany while maintaining pressure on Turkey with Italian support.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, our alliance against Germany should begin in earnest. I'm moving A GAL to support your A WAR while positioning A BUD to attack RUM with your support. Meanwhile, I've successfully taken Constantinople and will press further into Turkey. Can you support A BUD-RUM this turn? This would significantly strengthen our eastern flank against both Turkey and Germany.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I've kept my word and moved to ION as promised. I've also taken Constantinople from Turkey as we discussed. I propose we continue our coordination against Turkey - I'll use F ION to support your moves in the Mediterranean if you'll avoid any moves against my territories. What are your plans this turn? I suggest you move A VEN-TRI with my support from TYR to strengthen our mutual position against Germany.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Turkey, the situation has changed dramatically with my forces now in Constantinople. I propose a ceasefire where you keep Smyrna and Ankara while I retain Bulgaria, Greece and Constantinople. This arrangement would allow you to focus on defending against potential threats from Russia and Italy rather than continuing a costly war with me. What say you to this reasonable proposal?</li>

<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, neighbor. I propose maintaining the status quo in GAL and RUM. I am concerned about GER's expansionist tendencies and believe we should explore a potential alliance to contain them. What are your thoughts on this matter?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, I reiterate my demand for your withdrawal from BUL and GRE. Your continued occupation of these territories is unacceptable. I will not cease my attacks until you comply. I am willing to discuss terms for a peaceful resolution only after you have withdrawn.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am moving F ADR to TRI to support you against Turkey. I will also move A APU to NAP to defend against France. Let's coordinate our attacks on Turkey this turn.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I agree we must contain Germany's expansion. I'll support your position in Warsaw with A GAL while preparing to move on Rumania with A BUD. Can you support A BUD-RUM this turn? I've successfully taken Constantinople from Turkey and am pressing my advantage there. Our combined strength against Germany and Turkey will be formidable if we coordinate effectively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: There seems to be confusion - I cannot support you moving F ADR-TRI as Trieste is my home center and currently occupied by my army. Instead, I propose you move F ADR-ALB to threaten Turkey's position while I use F ION to support your operations. I'm planning to move A TYR to support A TRI against any potential threats, and will use my position in Constantinople to further pressure Turkey.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your demands are unreasonable now that I control Constantinople. I offer a final chance for peace: I keep Constantinople, Bulgaria and Greece, while you retain Smyrna and Ankara. We can establish a demilitarized zone in the Aegean. This is generous considering my current position. Refuse, and I'll be forced to press further into your territory with Italian and Russian support.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, your proposal is insulting. I will never accept your occupation of Constantinople. I demand your unconditional withdrawal from BUL, GRE, and CON. I will continue to attack your holdings until you comply. There will be no ceasefire until you withdraw.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Russia is ready to move against Germany. I will support A WAR to GAL. I cannot support A BUD to RUM this turn, as I need to secure BUL. However, I am open to coordinating our efforts against GER in the future. Let's discuss a long-term strategy to contain GER's expansion.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, excellent work on taking Constantinople! I will support your fleet in the Ionian. However, I cannot move A VEN to TRI as Germany is a greater threat. I will move A APU to NAP to defend against France. I suggest we focus on securing the Balkans and containing Germany. What are your thoughts on a coordinated attack on Smyrna next turn?</li>
</ul></div>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I understand your focus on Bulgaria, though I'm disappointed you can't support my move to Rumania. I'll still support your position with A GAL while maintaining pressure on Turkey from Constantinople. I'm planning to move A TYR to support A TRI defensively while using F ION to threaten Turkey's Mediterranean position. Let's continue coordinating against Germany - their expansion is indeed concerning and requires our joint attention.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Thank you for your support in the Ionian. I'll use F ION to threaten Turkey's position while maintaining A TRI and supporting it with A TYR. A coordinated attack on Smyrna next turn is an excellent suggestion - I could move F ION-AEG this turn to set up that attack. However, I'm concerned about your mention of moving F ADR-TRI earlier - please confirm you won't be moving against my home center, as this would force me to redirect forces away from our Turkish campaign.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your stubbornness is unfortunate. With my army in Constantinople, fleet in the Ionian, and control of Bulgaria and Greece, your position is increasingly untenable. I now have coordination with both Italy and Russia, who share my interest in containing your power. This is your final opportunity for a reasonable settlement before I press further into Ankara and Smyrna with allied support. The diplomatic landscape has shifted - consider your position carefully.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, your desperation is amusing. I will never accept your occupation of CON, BUL, or GRE. I will continue to attack your holdings until you are driven out of the Balkans. There will be no ceasefire until you unconditionally surrender. Prepare for your demise.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, my apologies for the confusion. I will move F ADR to ALB as you suggest. I will also move A APU to NAP to defend against France. Let's coordinate our attacks on Turkey this turn. I will support your fleet in the Ionian.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: I will support A WAR to GAL. I cannot support A BUD to RUM this turn, as I need to secure BUL. However, I am open to coordinating our efforts against GER in the future.

Let's continue our alliance against Germany - I'm committed to containing their expansion and will coordinate with you on future moves against them.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Thank you for clarifying about F ADR-ALB. I'll be moving F ION-GRE to secure my position there while pressing into Turkey with A CON-ANK. I'll maintain A TRI with support from A TYR to secure our mutual border. Next turn, we can coordinate an attack on Smyrna as you suggested, potentially with my fleet moving to AEG. Let's continue our successful coordination against Turkey while remaining vigilant about Germany's expansion.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: With my army now moving from Constantinople to Ankara, I control the diplomatic and military initiative. My alliance with Russia and coordination with Italy means your position will only deteriorate further. I offer one final reasonable settlement: you retain Smyrna while I keep my current holdings. This allows you to preserve your remaining power rather than face complete elimination. The choice is yours - pragmatic acceptance or continued decline.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I successfully captured Constantinople from Turkey with A BUL-CON while moving F GRE-ION to strengthen my Mediterranean position. I also repositioned A VIE-GAL to prepare for potential operations against Russia or Germany. My armies in TRI, TYR, and BUD held their positions, maintaining my defensive line. Meanwhile, England moved into Holland and Kiel, France repositioned in the Mediterranean, Germany took Paris and St. Petersburg, and Russia moved to Ukraine and Warsaw.
Russia proposed an alliance against Germany but refused to support my move to Rumania, claiming they need to secure Bulgaria instead. Italy initially caused confusion by suggesting they would move F ADR-TRI (my home center) but later clarified they meant F ADR-ALB. They proposed coordinating against Turkey with a future attack on Smyrna. Turkey remained belligerent, demanding I withdraw from Constantinople, Bulgaria, and Greece - an unreasonable position given my current military advantage.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will support Russia against Germany with A GAL while pressing my advantage against Turkey. My planned moves are: A CON-ANK to further penetrate Turkish territory, F ION-AEG to threaten Smyrna, A TYR S A TRI to secure my home center, A BUD H to maintain my defensive position, and A GAL S A WAR to help Russia against Germany. I'm wary of Italy's mixed messages about Trieste and will watch their moves carefully while maintaining our coordination against Turkey.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully captured Ankara with my army from Constantinople while attempting to move into the Aegean. I maintained defensive positions in Tyrolia, Trieste, Galicia, and Budapest. Russia moved into Warsaw and Sevastopol, while Italy attempted to move into Venice and the Ionian. Turkey tried to move into the Aegean. I built a new army in Vienna, strengthening my position.
Russia offered to maintain the status quo in Galicia but rejected my proposal to support a move into Rumania, citing their alliance with Turkey. Italy initially proposed a truce but later declared it over, planning to move F ADR to ALB without supporting my moves. Turkey demanded withdrawal from Bulgaria and Greece with threats of attacks. Germany did not respond to my non-aggression pact proposal.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I'll execute my assault on Turkey with A ANK-SMY while attempting F ION-ADR. I'll support Russia's A WAR with my A GAL to maintain that relationship despite their Turkish alliance. I'll keep A TYR and A TRI in defensive positions to guard against potential Italian aggression. My goal is to eliminate Turkey quickly, then pivot to address the German threat in coordination with Russia if possible. I'll maintain defensive positions against Italy while seeking to improve relations.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I see we both face pressure from Germany's expansion. I propose we coordinate against them - I'll order A BOH-MUN and A GAL support A BUD-RUM. In exchange, I ask you to support my move into Rumania with F SEV. This gives us both strategic advantages - I can pressure Germany while you can focus on defending Moscow. Let me know if this arrangement works for you.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, I'm planning a decisive move against Venice with A TYR-VEN supported by F ADR and A TRI. However, I'd prefer cooperation over conflict. If you agree to move A VEN-APU and A APU-NAP, I'll redirect my forces to support you against Turkey instead. We could coordinate an attack on the Ionian Sea to pressure Turkey's remaining positions. What do you say to this arrangement?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Germany, your expansion is impressive but has created concern among other powers. I propose a non-aggression pact between us - I'll not move against Munich if you agree not to threaten my territories. This would allow us both to focus on other fronts where we have greater interests. Are you amenable to such an arrangement?</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I regret that our alliance has broken down. However, I believe that we can still find a way to coexist peacefully. I propose a non-aggression pact. What do you say?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: AUT, withdraw from BUL and GRE. Your continued occupation is unacceptable. I will continue to pressure you in the Balkans until you comply. Surrender now and avoid further bloodshed.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I understand your concerns about the Balkans. I'm planning to move A BOH-MUN to pressure Germany, which benefits us both. Regarding RUM, I need to secure it to counter German expansion - I'll move A BUD-RUM with A GAL support. If you support this with F SEV, we can effectively contain Germany while maintaining our cooperation. I have no designs on your other territories and see our alliance as crucial against the German threat.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I appreciate your proposal for non-aggression. To demonstrate my commitment, I'll redirect my forces away from Venice if you agree to move your units southward. Specifically, I propose you move A VEN-APU and A APU-NAP while I focus on pressuring Turkey's remaining positions. We could coordinate against Turkey's fleet in ION next turn. This arrangement would benefit us both - you secure your home centers while I eliminate a mutual threat.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your expansion has been impressive, but it's created a precarious balance of power. I'm moving A BOH-MUN this turn, but I'm open to discussing a future non-aggression pact that would benefit us both.

I will move A VEN to APU and A APU to NAP as you requested, if you agree to cede Trieste. This will allow us to focus on our common enemy, Turkey.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings. I appreciate your concern about GER's expansion. However, I cannot support your move into RUM with F SEV, as it conflicts with my alliance with TUR. I propose we maintain the status quo in GAL and RUM for now. I am open to discussing future cooperation against GER, but only if it does not compromise my existing alliances.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I understand your alliance with Turkey constrains your options. I'll proceed with A BOH-MUN to pressure Germany independently, which still serves our mutual interest in containing German expansion. Regarding Galicia, I'll maintain our status quo agreement. While I must secure my position against Turkey, I value our cooperation and will avoid actions that directly threaten your territories. Let's continue discussing how to address the German threat without compromising your existing alliances.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I cannot cede Trieste as it's one of my home centers, but I'm willing to redirect my forces away from Venice as a gesture of goodwill. I'll order A TYR-VEN with support from F ADR and A TRI to secure my position, but I propose we establish a demilitarized zone afterward. If you move your units southward as suggested, we can negotiate a more permanent arrangement next turn that respects both our territorial interests while focusing on Turkey. Consider this a necessary defensive move rather than aggression.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your demands are unreasonable given the current military situation. I now control Ankara and Smyrna, and your position is untenable. Instead of empty threats, I propose a realistic arrangement: I'll allow you to maintain Constantinople if you cease all hostilities against my territories. This is the only offer you'll receive - continued resistance will result in your complete elimination. Consider your response carefully, as this may be your last opportunity for survival.</li>

Consider this a defensive necessity rather than permanent aggression.</li>

Such an arrangement would allow us both to focus our resources more efficiently elsewhere.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully moved into Smyrna from Ankara, securing another Turkish center. I also moved my fleet from Ionian Sea to Adriatic, repositioned from Vienna to Bohemia, and maintained positions in Trieste, Galicia, and Budapest. Germany was forced to retreat from Burgundy to Munich after French pressure.
Russia wants to maintain status quo in Galicia and Rumania, citing alliance with Turkey, but plans to move Warsaw to Galicia. Italy proposed a non-aggression pact but demanded Trieste, which I refused. Turkey continues making unrealistic demands for withdrawal from Bulgaria and Greece despite their weak position. No meaningful negotiations with Germany, England, or France occurred.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I'll attack Venice with A TYR-VEN supported by F ADR and A TRI to secure my northern flank against Italy. I'll also attempt A BOH-MUN to pressure Germany. For Turkey, I'll use F ADR to support an attack on the Ionian Sea while maintaining my position in Smyrna. I'll keep A GAL in place to maintain the status quo with Russia as agreed. A BUD will hold to protect against any Russian moves toward Rumania.</li>

My A GAL will hold to respect our agreement. I'm also planning to eliminate Turkey's last stronghold with A CON-SMY. Would you consider supporting my A BUD-RUM in a future turn once Turkey is eliminated? This would help us both contain Germany more effectively.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: I'm glad to hear you're open to improving relations. I propose we start with a concrete step: I'll order F ADR-ALB to move away from your territory as a gesture of goodwill, while you agree not to attack TRI or VEN. I'm focusing on eliminating Turkey with A CON-SMY and would welcome your cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean afterward. A demilitarized zone could work well once we've established basic trust. What specific moves are you planning this turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [TUR]: Your demand is unrealistic given the current military situation. I control Constantinople, Bulgaria, and Greece, and am positioned to take Smyrna.

What are your thoughts on a coordinated defense of our territories against GER?</li>

What specific moves are you planning against German expansion this turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your demand for Trieste is completely unacceptable - it's my home center and vital to my position. I'm willing to move F ADR-ALB as a gesture of goodwill if you agree not to attack my territories, but I cannot and will not cede Trieste under any circumstances. Supporting Turkey only prolongs a conflict with a dying power while Germany grows stronger. I suggest we find common ground against the real threats rather than fighting each other.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In the previous turn, I built a new army in Vienna, strengthening my position with 8 units on the board. France built an army in Brest, while Turkey disbanded their fleet in the Aegean, further weakening their position. I now control 8 supply centers including Constantinople and Ankara, positioning me as one of the dominant powers.
Russia proposed maintaining the status quo in Galicia and Rumania, showing interest in future cooperation against Germany but remaining committed to their Turkish alliance. Italy demanded Trieste as a condition for peace, an unacceptable ultimatum that signals continued hostility. Turkey remains belligerent despite their weakened position, making empty threats. I received no response from Germany despite reaching out about their expansion and potential non-aggression.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will execute a multi-front strategy: A CON-SMY to eliminate Turkey's last center, A BOH-SIL to pressure Germany's flank, A VEN-ROM to counter Italian aggression, and F ADR-ALB as a strategic repositioning. I'll hold A GAL to honor my agreement with Russia while maintaining defensive positions with A BUD, A TRI, and A VIE to protect my home centers. My primary objectives are eliminating Turkey, containing Italy, and establishing a stronger position against Germany's expansion.</li>

The German threat grows while we squabble over Galicia - a coordinated strategy would serve us both better.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn I successfully moved into Smyrna, capturing a Turkish center. I also secured Silesia from Bohemia, held my positions in Trieste, Vienna, Galicia, Budapest, and Venice, and moved my fleet from the Adriatic to Albania. Italy attempted to move into Venice but failed. Russia moved from Warsaw to Livonia and attempted to move from Rumania to Sevastopol. Turkey retreated to Ankara.
Negotiations were tense on multiple fronts. Italy is openly hostile, demanding Trieste and rejecting all peace offers. Russia plans to move to Galicia despite my warnings, refusing to support my move into Warsaw. Germany proposed a non-aggression pact but demanded support for Bohemia and Galicia in return. Turkey continues to demand withdrawal from Smyrna and the Balkans with empty threats, despite their weakened position.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will move A SIL-WAR to counter German expansion, A GAL S A BUD-RUM to pressure Russia, and defend Trieste against Italian aggression. I'll maintain my position in Smyrna while ignoring Turkey's empty threats. With Germany, I'll maintain the appearance of cooperation while strengthening my position. My specific moves: A SIL-WAR, A GAL S A BUD-RUM, A BUD-RUM, A TRI H, A VIE-BOH, F ALB-GRE, A VEN-ROM, A SMY H.</li>

We both face threats from other powers - you from England and France in the west, me from Italy and Russia. A stable eastern front benefits us both while we address these more pressing concerns. What terms would you find acceptable?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Italy, this hostility between us serves neither of our interests. I have no designs on Rome or Naples, but I will not surrender Trieste under any circumstances - it's my home center. I propose a ceasefire: you don't attack Trieste or Venice, I don't attack Rome or Naples. We could even coordinate against France in the Mediterranean if you're interested. This endless conflict only weakens us both while others grow stronger.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Russia, I notice you're down to just two centers while Germany continues to expand. I propose we coordinate against German expansion - I can support you in retaking St. Petersburg while you support me in holding Warsaw. Turkey is nearly eliminated and can no longer protect you, while Germany grows stronger each year. Let's work together before it's too late for both of us.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, I am moving my forces to defend against further Turkish aggression. I suggest you do the same. I will be moving A ROM to VEN and A APU to TRI to defend against any Turkish incursion into Trieste. I suggest you focus on defending your own territories.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I'm willing to withdraw from Warsaw if you'll agree to a mutual non-aggression pact covering Bohemia, Silesia, and Warsaw. However, I cannot support you into Galicia as it would expose my flank to Russia. Instead, I propose we both focus on our respective threats - you against England and France, me against Italy and Turkey's remnants. I'll order A WAR-UKR this turn as a gesture of goodwill if you agree not to move into Bohemia.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I agree we should coordinate against Germany's expansion. Their control of St. Petersburg threatens both of us. I propose this: I'll support your move to retake St. Petersburg if you'll support my hold in Warsaw against German aggression. Turkey is nearly eliminated and can no longer be a reliable ally for you. Germany now has 5 centers and continues to grow - we must act together before they become unstoppable. What specific moves would you suggest for this turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your deception is transparent. Moving to Trieste and Venice is clearly an attack on my territories, not a defense against a nearly eliminated Turkey. I will defend my centers vigorously. However, I still believe peace between us is possible. I propose a DMZ in Tyrolia and Venice, with neither of us moving into the other's home centers.

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I cannot support you into Galicia or Bohemia as these are critical buffer territories for my security. However, I propose a more limited agreement: I'll withdraw from Warsaw (ordering A WAR-UKR) if you agree not to attack Bohemia this turn. This gives us both breathing room to address our respective threats - you against England/France, me against Italy who has just explicitly threatened to attack Trieste. We can negotiate a more comprehensive agreement next turn once we've secured our immediate positions.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Germany is demanding I support them into Galicia, which I've refused. They're clearly trying to eliminate you while expanding westward. I propose concrete action: I'll support your F SEV-BLA this turn to pressure Turkey's last unit while maintaining my position in Galicia. In return, I ask that you don't attack my units. Germany now controls 5 centers and is targeting both of us - we must coordinate or be eliminated separately. What specific moves can we agree on to counter German expansion?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your intentions are now clear. Be warned that attacking Trieste will only result in mutual destruction while France and Germany grow stronger. I will defend my territories with all available force. My fleet in Greece and army in Smyrna are positioned to strike at your centers should you proceed with this aggression. This is your final chance for a reasonable settlement - a DMZ in Tyrolia and Venice would allow us both to address the growing threats from France and Germany instead of weakening each other.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I built two armies in Budapest and Vienna, strengthening my position. Russia retreated from Rumania to Ukraine and disbanded armies in Livonia and Ukraine. England built a fleet in Liverpool, while Germany disbanded an army in Silesia and Italy disbanded a fleet in the Aegean. I now control 11 centers with 10 units, making me the strongest power on the board.
Italy explicitly threatened to attack Trieste with moves from Rome to Venice and Apulia to Trieste. Germany proposed a non-aggression pact but demanded support into Bohemia and Galicia, which I cannot accept. Russia was evasive but concerned about German expansion. Turkey, despite being nearly eliminated, made empty threats about reclaiming territory. No meaningful agreements were reached with any power.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> My priority is defending Trieste against Italy's declared attack. I'll order A TRI S A VEN, A VEN H to ensure Italy cannot take either center. I'll move A BOH-MUN to pressure Germany while maintaining A GAL to protect against Russian moves. A WAR will support A GAL or move to Ukraine depending on final assessment. A RUM, A BUD, and A VIE will maintain defensive positions while F GRE and A ANK will threaten Italian and Turkish centers. I need to prevent Italy from taking Trieste at all costs while positioning for a potential counter-attack.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully moved A WAR-MOS and A MUN-BOH, strengthening my position in the east and creating a buffer with Germany. I also moved F AEG-SMY and A SMY-ANK, securing Turkish territory. My armies in Venice and Trieste supported each other, maintaining my defensive line against Italy. Meanwhile, England lost Norway, Germany built in Munich, and Russia and Turkey both lost units.
Italy has openly declared war, threatening to take Venice and Trieste. I've established a promising alliance with France to contain Italy, with France maintaining F ION to pressure Italy while I defend my territories. Germany and I negotiated a non-aggression pact where I'll focus on Italy and stay neutral in their conflict with France/England, while they respect my positions in BOH and GAL. Russia remains cautious but open to future cooperation against Germany, though currently committed to Turkey.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I'll maintain my defensive position in Venice and Trieste against Italy's attack. I'll hold BOH as a gesture of good faith to Germany while preparing for potential counterattacks into Italian territory. I'll use F SMY to increase naval pressure on Italy, potentially moving toward the Aegean. I'm coordinating with France against both Italy and Germany, with France pressuring Germany from the west while I focus on Italy. I'm publicly honoring my non-aggression pact with Germany while privately coordinating with France against them - a necessary deception given Germany's expansion.</li>

Your F ION is crucial to our strategy - can you maintain position there or perhaps move to TYS to further pressure Italy? Let's coordinate our moves to maximize effectiveness against both Italy and Germany.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I appreciate your proposal and am willing to maintain non-aggression regarding BOH and GAL. However, I cannot commit to neutrality against France and England as I must maintain flexibility in my diplomatic relations. I propose instead a more limited agreement: I will not attack your home centers if you respect my current positions in MUN and BOH. This allows us both to focus on our immediate concerns without overcommitting to positions that may change as the board evolves.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your threats are hollow. I have the military strength, diplomatic support, and strategic position to not only defend my territories but to eliminate you entirely. France and I are coordinating a pincer movement against your remaining centers.

Germany is clearly concerned about my presence in Berlin - this distraction works to our advantage as we continue our coordinated strategy against both powers.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: My move to Berlin was indeed strategic, but not aimed at threatening your Baltic interests. I propose the following arrangement: I'll withdraw from Berlin if you agree to a demilitarized Munich and focus your expansion northward rather than eastward.

My other units will maintain defensive positions while I continue to coordinate with France against both Italy and Germany. I've told Germany I'll withdraw from Berlin next turn as a compromise, but this is primarily to buy time while I strengthen my position.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Our alliance continues to bear fruit as we dominate the board. I'm planning to attack Italy this turn with A VEN-ROM supported by A TRI to eliminate one of their centers. I'll also move A BOH-MUN and hold Berlin despite German protests. Can you maintain pressure on Italy with your fleet in ION while continuing to push against Germany from the west? Together we can eliminate Italy and contain Germany's expansion.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I understand your concerns about Berlin, but my position there is currently necessary for my security given Italy's continued hostility. I propose a compromise: I'll maintain my current position this turn while you focus on securing your northern territories against England. Next turn, I can consider a mutual demilitarization of our border regions if you demonstrate good faith by not attacking my units. What specific moves are you planning this turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your continued threats against Trieste and Venice are futile given your weakened position with only two centers remaining. I'm offering one final chance for peace: withdraw your forces from the border and I'll guarantee your survival. Otherwise, I'll be forced to eliminate you entirely with support from France. The choice is yours - meaningful cooperation or certain elimination.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria is a menace to all of Europe! Their aggression must be stopped. I call on all nations to join me in containing their expansionist ambitions.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: AUT, I am moving A MOS to WAR. This is merely a repositioning of forces and does not indicate any hostile intent towards you at this time. I suggest you focus your efforts on containing GER in the north.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: To Austria: I propose a coordinated effort to contain Italy. I will maintain F ION in position to pressure Italy. Can you continue to pressure Italy from Venice? A coordinated effort will ensure Italy does not become a threat to either of us. What are your intentions regarding Italy?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Greetings. I am concerned about your continued presence in BER. While I appreciate the non-aggression pact, this situation is untenable. I need BER. When can I expect your forces to withdraw? I am willing to offer further concessions in BOH if necessary.</li>

I'll also move A BOH-MUN and hold Berlin to maintain pressure on Germany. Your fleet in ION is crucial to our strategy - can you use it to cut support for any Italian defense of Rome? After Italy falls, we'll be positioned to divide the board between us, with you dominating the west and me the east.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I understand your concerns about Berlin, but my position there is strategically necessary at present. I propose this compromise: I'll maintain my current positions this turn while you focus on securing your northern territories against England. If you demonstrate good faith by not attacking my units, I can consider withdrawing from Berlin in the future turn as part of a broader agreement. What specific non-aggressive moves can you commit to this turn to build trust?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: I acknowledge your move to Warsaw and appreciate your transparency. I have no immediate hostile intentions toward you, as my focus remains on containing Germany and eliminating Italy.

I'm also moving A BOH-MUN and holding Berlin to maintain pressure on Germany. After eliminating Italy, we should coordinate our next moves against Germany - I can push from the east while you continue from the west. Your fleet in ION cutting support for Italy's defense will be crucial. Together we can dominate the board and divide it between us.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I cannot withdraw from Berlin this turn as it would compromise my strategic position. However, I propose this concrete solution: I will not attack your remaining centers if you focus on defending against England rather than attacking me. Next turn, I can consider a mutual agreement where I withdraw from Berlin in exchange for guaranteed non-aggression in Munich and my other territories. This gives us both time to address more immediate threats while working toward a stable arrangement.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I successfully moved from Sevastopol to Moscow and from Bohemia to Munich, extending my control. I also moved from Berlin to Prussia, maintaining my position in Germany. I supported my positions in Venice, Trieste, Budapest, and Rumania while moving my fleet from Aegean to Ionian Sea. France moved into Belgium and Tyrrhenian Sea, while Germany repositioned in the north. Russia moved from Moscow to Warsaw, and Italy moved from Naples to Rome.
France and I coordinated our attack on Italy, with plans for me to take Rome with Venice supported by Trieste while France uses their Ionian fleet to pressure Italy. We reaffirmed our alliance to divide the board between us after eliminating Italy. Germany is increasingly hostile about my occupation of Berlin, threatening war if I don't withdraw. Italy made empty threats despite their weak position with only two centers. Russia claimed their move to Warsaw was not hostile.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Rome with A VEN-ROM supported by A TRI to eliminate one of Italy's centers. I'll hold my position in Berlin despite German threats and maintain my other positions to keep pressure on Germany. I'll coordinate with France to eliminate Italy completely, after which we'll focus on containing and reducing Germany. My specific moves: A VEN-ROM (supported by A TRI), A TRI S A VEN-ROM, A MUN H, A PRU H, A MOS H, and maintain positions elsewhere.</li>

Can you maintain pressure with your fleet in ION? After Italy falls, we should coordinate our attack on Germany - they're the greatest threat to both of us now. I'm holding MUN and have units in MOS and WAR to pressure them from the east while you push from the west.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I understand your concerns about my presence in your territory. However, the strategic reality is that we both face threats - you from England in the north, and I from Italy in the south. I propose a temporary arrangement: I'll maintain my current positions but won't advance further into your territory if you focus your efforts northward against England rather than against me. This gives us both time to address our immediate threats.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your position with only two centers is precarious, and your threats against my territories are unrealistic.

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your continued occupation of Munich is unacceptable. I demand your immediate withdrawal. I am willing to offer BOH and GAL in exchange for your immediate departure from MUN. This is my final offer. Failure to comply will be considered an act of war.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: To Austria, I propose a coordinated effort to contain Italy. I will maintain F ION in position to pressure them, and I encourage you to continue your pressure from Venice. A united front will ensure Italy's defeat. Let me know if you are amenable to this arrangement.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Excellent, our alliance continues to bear fruit. I will proceed with A VEN-ROM supported by A TRI to eliminate one of Italy's centers while you maintain pressure with F ION. After Italy falls, we should coordinate a pincer movement against Germany - I'll press from MUN, MOS, and WAR in the east while you push from the west. Together we can dominate the board and share the spoils. What are your thoughts on our post-Italy strategy against Germany?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your offer is noted but unrealistic given the strategic situation. I cannot withdraw from MUN while you maintain such a strong position in the north. Instead, I propose a more balanced arrangement: I will not advance further into your territory beyond MUN if you commit to not attacking my positions. This gives us both breathing room to address other threats - you with England in the north, and me with Italy in the south. Consider this carefully, as conflict between us would only benefit our mutual rivals.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your diplomatic posturing is futile given your precarious position with only two centers. The balance of power you speak of has already shifted decisively. I will be moving A VEN-ROM supported by A TRI this turn to eliminate one of your centers. You have no allies and no leverage. If you wish to survive in any capacity, cease all hostile rhetoric immediately and propose concrete terms for your surrender. Otherwise, prepare for elimination.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your proposal is insulting. I will not tolerate your presence in Munich any longer. I reiterate my demand for your immediate and unconditional withdrawal. If you do not comply, I will be forced to take action. Consider this your final warning. I will not offer BOH and GAL in exchange for your immediate departure from MUN.</li>

Germany is already showing signs of desperation with their ultimatums. Together we can divide the board between us and achieve dominance. What specific moves are you planning against Germany next turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your threats are noted but unrealistic. I control 15 supply centers to your 6, with armies in MUN, MOS, and WAR positioned to strike deeper into your territory. England and France are pressuring you from the west. Rather than making ultimatums from a position of weakness, I suggest you reconsider my offer of non-aggression. I have no desire for unnecessary conflict, but I will not withdraw from strategically vital positions while you maintain such hostile rhetoric. The choice is yours - cooperation or mutual destruction.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your defiance is futile. With only two centers remaining against my fifteen, and France coordinating with me to eliminate you, your position is hopeless.

I will maintain my current positions but am still open to a non-aggression arrangement if you adopt a more realistic diplomatic stance.

After eliminating Italy, I'll move A GAL-SIL to threaten Berlin while holding my other positions. Your western pressure combined with my eastern advance will leave Germany with nowhere to retreat. Together, we'll dominate the board and can discuss a fair division of the remaining territories.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: I see no value in further diplomatic exchanges given your refusal to acknowledge the strategic reality. My forces will maintain their positions in Munich, Moscow, and Warsaw while preparing for further advances. Your threats of war are meaningless when you're already surrounded - France presses from the west while my armies control your eastern flank. I offered you reasonable terms for de-escalation which you rejected. The consequences of that decision will soon become apparent.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your defiance in the face of inevitable defeat shows admirable spirit, but changes nothing. My armies will take Rome this turn, and Naples will follow shortly after. You had your chance for a dignified surrender and chose war instead. So be it. The full might of my empire will now be brought to bear against your remaining territories until Italy is completely removed from the map.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: To Austria, our alliance is proving fruitful. I will maintain F ION in position to pressure Italy and support A SPA to MAR. After Italy falls, I will move A BEL to BUR, A MAR to GAS, F TUN to WES, and F BRE holds. This will position us for a coordinated attack on Germany. I anticipate your build in VIE.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, enjoy your hollow victory. You may crush Italy, but you will never erase our legacy. Your empire will crumble, and Italy will rise again from the ashes. Remember this day as the beginning of your end.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your delusions of grandeur are pathetic. Munich is German, and I will take it. Prepare for war. Your threats are meaningless. I will crush you.</li>
</ul></div>
<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> In S1911M, I held most of my positions while moving F ION to TYS and attempting to take Rome with A VEN, but Italy defended. France successfully moved F ENG to BEL with support from A BUR. Germany moved A BER to PRU, A NWY to STP, F BAL to PRU, and F HEL to KIE, while holding F BOT and A STP.
France and I reaffirmed our strong alliance, coordinating against Italy and planning future moves against Germany. Italy defiantly rejected my offer to let them survive with a single center, choosing to fight to the end. Germany was hostile and demanding, insisting I withdraw from Munich despite the clear strategic disadvantage they face. They rejected my offer for de-escalation and threatened war.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Rome with A VEN supported by A TRI to eliminate Italy. I'll maintain my positions in Munich, Moscow, and Warsaw to pressure Germany. After taking Rome, I plan to move against Germany from multiple fronts in coordination with France's western pressure. While I maintain my alliance with France publicly, I'm aware that once Italy and Germany are weakened further, France may become my next target - or I theirs. I need to ensure I maintain numerical superiority in centers and units.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Our alliance continues to bear fruit as we dominate the board. I plan to take Naples this turn with F TYS-NAP supported by A ROM, eliminating Italy completely. For Germany, I'll move A GAL-SIL, A MUN-BER, and A VIE-BOH to increase pressure from the east while you push from the west. Let's coordinate our final assault on Germany - what are your planned moves this turn?</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: The strategic reality is clear - you're surrounded on multiple fronts with France pushing from the west while I control territories to your east and south. I propose a final opportunity for de-escalation: withdraw your units from St. Petersburg and Prussia, allowing me to secure those territories without conflict, and I'll guarantee your survival in Scandinavia. This is your last chance for a dignified resolution before our combined forces overwhelm you.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your position is untenable with just one center remaining against my eleven units. I'm moving F TYS-NAP supported by A ROM this turn to eliminate your last center. You've fought valiantly, but further resistance is futile. I offer you one final chance: support my F TYS-NAP and I'll allow you to maintain a presence in the game by not eliminating your last unit. Otherwise, your complete removal is inevitable.</li>

I am moving A NAP to ROM to contest your occupation. I expect to be eliminated this turn, but I will make you pay for every inch of Italian soil you conquer.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your continued presence in Munich is unacceptable. Withdraw immediately or face the consequences. I will not tolerate your encroachment on German territory. I suggest you focus on Italy and the Balkans, as we previously discussed. Do not test my patience.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: To Austria: Italy continues to defy reason and occupy Tunis. I propose a coordinated effort to contain and eliminate them. I will maintain F ION in position to pressure Italy, and I urge you to continue your pressure from Venice. A swift end to Italy will allow us to focus our combined might on Germany.</li>

For Germany, I'm executing a coordinated eastern offensive with A MUN-BER, A GAL-SIL, and A VIE-BOH to increase pressure while you push from the west. Once Italy falls, we'll have a clear path to divide the remaining German territories between us. What specific moves are you planning against Germany this turn? Our pincer strategy continues to work perfectly.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your position is rapidly deteriorating with France advancing from the west while I control territories to your east and south. I'm moving into Berlin this turn and there's nothing you can do to stop it. However, I offer one final diplomatic solution: withdraw from St. Petersburg and Prussia, focusing your defense in Scandinavia, and I'll guarantee your survival with those territories. Reject this offer, and our combined forces will systematically eliminate you from the board.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your defiance is admirable but strategically pointless. I'm moving F TYS-NAP supported by A ROM this turn, which will eliminate your last center. This is your final opportunity: support my move into Naples and I'll allow your army to survive the elimination of your supply centers. Otherwise, complete removal awaits.

I will also move A SPA to MAR to secure my southern flank. I will move A BUR to BEL, supported by F ENG. What are your specific orders for this turn?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your arrogance is astounding. My offer stands: focus on Italy and the Balkans. Your 'strategic reality' is a temporary inconvenience, not a permanent condition.

Once Italy falls, we'll have them in a perfect pincer movement. Let's continue our successful alliance and divide the remaining German territories between us - you taking the western centers while I secure the eastern ones.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your threats ring hollow when surrounded on multiple fronts. I'm moving into Berlin this turn with A MUN-BER while simultaneously advancing A GAL-SIL and A VIE-BOH. France pushes from the west while I control your eastern and southern flanks. This isn't arrogance - it's strategic reality. My final offer stands: withdraw from St. Petersburg and Prussia to focus on Scandinavia, and I'll guarantee your survival there. Otherwise, our combined forces will systematically eliminate you from the board.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your resistance ends this turn. I'm moving F TYS-NAP supported by A ROM, which will eliminate your last center regardless of your move to Rome. While I respect your fighting spirit, the outcome is inevitable. My offer to allow your army to survive after losing your centers was genuine, but your refusal means complete elimination.

<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your empty threats only highlight your desperate position. I'm moving A MUN-BER this turn while advancing on multiple fronts. The strategic reality is undeniable - you're surrounded with no viable path to survival unless you accept my terms.

Otherwise, our combined forces will methodically eliminate you from the board. The choice between dignified compromise and total elimination is yours.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your defiance ends today. I'm moving F TYS-NAP supported by A ROM, which will eliminate your last center regardless of your move to Rome. While I respect your fighting spirit, the outcome is inevitable. You've fought admirably throughout this campaign, but the strategic reality cannot be denied.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Last turn, I successfully captured Rome from Italy with A VEN-ROM supported by F TYS. I maintained positions in Munich, Moscow, and Warsaw, consolidating my control over eastern Europe. England moved into the Mid-Atlantic and Irish Sea, while France took Belgium and Western Mediterranean. Germany repositioned toward Scandinavia and the Baltic, moving into Helgoland, Prussia, Finland, and Livonia.
Italy remains defiant despite imminent elimination, refusing cooperation and vowing to contest Rome. Germany is hostile and delusional, making empty threats while surrounded on multiple fronts. They've rejected my final offer to withdraw from St. Petersburg and Prussia in exchange for survival in Scandinavia. France continues to be a reliable ally, coordinating our pincer movement against Germany and supporting my elimination of Italy.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will eliminate Italy this turn with F TYS-NAP supported by A ROM. Against Germany, I'll execute a coordinated eastern offensive with A MUN-BER, A GAL-SIL, and A VIE-BOH while maintaining pressure with A WAR and A MOS. My alliance with France remains strong as we divide the board - they control the west while I dominate the east. After Italy falls, we'll focus on systematically dismantling Germany's remaining positions.</li>

I offer one final chance for survival: withdraw from Prussia and Finland, allowing me those centers, and I'll establish a non-aggression pact allowing you to maintain your remaining territories. This is a generous offer given the circumstances. The alternative is your complete elimination as France and I continue our coordinated assault.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Your position is untenable with just one center remaining. I control Naples with my fleet and will be moving against Apulia this turn.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I successfully captured Naples with F TYS, forcing Italy's army to retreat to Apulia. I also took Berlin from Germany with A MUN-BER and moved A GAL-SIL to strengthen my position there. I successfully moved A MOS-LVN and A SMY-CON, further consolidating my position. I now control 16 centers, dominating the board with France as my ally.
Germany and Italy both rejected my ultimatums with empty threats despite their weak positions. Germany refused to withdraw from Prussia and Finland, while Italy rejected my offer for a diplomatic surrender. France confirmed our alliance against Germany but surprisingly mentioned taking 'all of Italy' after Italy falls, which conflicts with my current control of Rome and Naples. This requires careful management to maintain our alliance while protecting my Italian holdings.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will eliminate Italy by holding F NAP while supporting A ROM-APU. Against Germany, I'll execute a coordinated eastern offensive with A SIL S A BER, A WAR-PRU supported by A LVN, and A BER supporting the Prussia move. This should break their position in Prussia. I need to maintain my alliance with France while subtly establishing that Italian territories I've conquered remain mine. I'll continue our joint pressure against Germany while preparing for potential future tensions with France over Italian territories.</li>

You should press from Belgium toward Kiel. After Germany falls, we'll need to discuss the final division of territories, particularly regarding Italy which I've largely conquered.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I built a new army in Vienna, strengthening my dominant position. I now control 16 centers including Berlin, Rome, and Naples, with armies poised to take Venice (Italy's last center) and Prussia from Germany. Russia and Turkey have been eliminated, while I maintain a strong alliance with France.
France proposed continued cooperation against Germany but surprisingly claimed rights to Rome and Naples, which I already control. I firmly reminded France of our spheres of influence agreement (west for France, east including Italy for me). Germany and Italy both made delusional threats despite their precarious positions. I offered Italy survival with Venice if they supported my moves against Germany, but they refused. I offered Germany survival in Scandinavia if they withdrew from St. Petersburg and Prussia, but they rejected this final chance.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will take Venice with my army in Apulia, eliminating Italy. I'll attack Prussia from Warsaw with Livonian support while maintaining pressure on Germany from Berlin and Silesia. I'll continue my alliance with France against Germany while firmly maintaining my control over Italian territories. After Germany falls, I'll support France against England while consolidating my dominant position across Eastern Europe and Italy.</li>

I appreciate your western pressure against Germany - together we'll systematically dismantle them. I notice your mention of Italian territories - to clarify, as per our spheres of influence agreement, I maintain control of my hard-won Italian centers (Rome, Naples, and soon Venice) while you dominate the west.

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I successfully took Munich from Germany and Venice from Italy, continuing my expansion. I attempted to move into Prussia but was unsuccessful. I built a new army in Vienna, strengthening my position in Central Europe. I now control 16 centers, making me the dominant power on the board.
Italy is bitter about elimination and making empty threats. Germany remains defiant despite their weakened position, refusing my offer to withdraw from St. Petersburg and Prussia in exchange for survival in Scandinavia. Most significantly, France has revealed a major misunderstanding about our territorial agreement, claiming they expected to receive Rome and Naples despite my conquest of these centers. I firmly maintained that these Italian territories are within my eastern sphere of influence per our previous arrangement.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will continue my attack on Prussia with coordinated support to break Germany's position there. I'll maintain my hold on all Italian territories (Rome, Naples, Venice) as they're firmly in my sphere. I need to carefully manage the relationship with France - maintaining our alliance against Germany and England while firmly establishing boundaries regarding Italian territories. I'll move A VEN-ROM to secure my position in Italy, continue pressure on Prussia, and prepare for potential conflict with France if they persist in claiming my Italian centers.</li>

<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your continued occupation of Munich and Berlin is unacceptable. Withdraw immediately or face the consequences. I will not tolerate your encroachment on German territory any longer.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: To Austria: While our interests may diverge in Italy, we share a common enemy in Germany. I propose we coordinate our attacks to crush Germany from both sides. I will focus on the west, while you pressure from the east. A coordinated pincer movement will ensure Germany's swift defeat. What are your intentions?</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: France will not tolerate German aggression in Belgium. I demand Germany withdraw immediately, or face the full might of the French army. I also demand Italy relinquish Tunis. France will not be bullied. The glory of France will prevail!</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your continued occupation of Italian lands is an affront! I demand you withdraw your forces from Venice, Trieste, and Rome immediately. Failure to comply will result in swift and decisive action. I will not tolerate your aggression any longer.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: I agree our coordinated pincer movement against Germany is the optimal strategy. I'll be attacking Prussia from multiple directions while maintaining pressure from Berlin and Silesia. As for Italy, I must respectfully maintain that my conquests there (Rome, Naples, Venice) remain within my eastern sphere as per our earlier agreement about east/west division. Let's focus on eliminating Germany first, then we can discuss final territorial arrangements from a position of shared success.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your position is untenable. I control Berlin and Munich, with armies positioned to take Prussia. This final diplomatic offer expires now: withdraw from St. Petersburg and accept confinement to Scandinavia, and I will allow you to survive there. Your empty threats mean nothing when faced with the reality of your collapsing position. Choose survival in a reduced form or complete elimination - there is no third option.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: I understand your commitment to France. However, as Germany falls, consider the strategic implications of a dominant France controlling the entire western board. While I focus on securing Eastern Europe, perhaps we should maintain open communication to ensure neither France nor I grow too powerful. Balance of power serves all our interests in the long term. I respect your current alliance but suggest we keep diplomatic channels open.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your demands are laughable. I will not cede any territory. Your control of Berlin and Munich is temporary. Prepare to be driven out. I will not negotiate with weakness.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your arrogance is astounding. I will not be intimidated. I am moving A ROM to APU to prepare for the inevitable conflict. Withdraw from Italian lands now, or face the consequences.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [FRA]: To Austria: I agree to continue our pincer movement against Germany. I will focus on the west, while you pressure from the east. I will attack Prussia from multiple directions while maintaining pressure from Berlin and Silesia. Regarding Italy, I acknowledge your claims on Rome, Naples, and Venice. However, I believe a more equitable division of territories can be achieved after Germany is defeated. Let us discuss this further then.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I appreciate your concern about the balance of power, but I remain committed to my alliance with FRA. I believe that GER poses the greatest threat to European stability, and I will continue to work with FRA to dismantle GER. I will consider your concerns after GER is dealt with.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Excellent, our coordinated pincer movement against Germany will soon bring their downfall. I'll be attacking Prussia with support from multiple units while maintaining pressure from Berlin and Silesia. Once Germany is eliminated, I'm confident we can reach an amicable arrangement regarding the final territorial division. For now, let's focus on our shared goal of dismantling Germany's remaining positions. Your western pressure combined with my eastern offensive will ensure their swift defeat.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your delusions of strength are remarkable given your collapsing position. I control Berlin and Munich, with armies poised to take Prussia. My offer of survival in Scandinavia in exchange for withdrawal from St. Petersburg has now expired. I will systematically eliminate your remaining centers. Your empty threats only hasten your demise as they prevent any diplomatic resolution that might have preserved some portion of your power.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: I respect your commitment to France and agree that Germany poses an immediate threat. However, I encourage you to consider the long-term strategic balance once Germany falls. Neither a dominant France nor Austria serves your interests. While maintaining your current alliance, perhaps we could discuss contingency arrangements for the post-German landscape. Strategic flexibility will be valuable as the board evolves, and maintaining diplomatic options serves your long-term survival.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class='ms-4'><u>Received by AUT:</u><ul>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: Austria, your stubbornness will be your downfall. I will not rest until Italian lands are free. Prepare for war. I am moving A ROM to APU to prepare for an attack on Venice. Your time is running out.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Austria, your offer is rejected. I will not cede any territory. Your control of Berlin and Munich is fleeting. Prepare to be driven out. I will fight to the last man.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ENG]: AUT, I appreciate your continued concern about the balance of power. However, my commitment to FRA remains firm for now. I will keep diplomatic channels open, but my priority is the defeat of GER. After that, we can discuss the future of Europe.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: Our pincer movement against Germany is proceeding well. I'll be attacking Prussia with support from multiple units while maintaining pressure from Berlin and Silesia. My forces in Italy will secure my position there as we focus on eliminating Germany. Once Germany falls, I'm confident we can reach an equitable arrangement that respects our spheres of influence - you in the west, me in the east including Italy. Your western pressure combined with my eastern offensive ensures Germany's swift defeat.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ENG]: As Germany collapses, I urge you to consider the strategic balance of power. While I respect your alliance with France, neither a dominant France nor Austria serves your interests in the long term. I suggest maintaining diplomatic flexibility as the board evolves. My focus remains on securing Eastern Europe and Italy while coordinating with France against Germany, but I believe open communication between us serves both our interests as we approach the endgame.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: Your position is collapsing. I control Berlin and Munich with armies poised to take Prussia. My offer of survival in Scandinavia has expired due to your refusal to negotiate realistically. I will now systematically eliminate your remaining centers through coordinated attacks from multiple directions. Your empty threats only accelerate your demise by preventing any diplomatic resolution that might have preserved some portion of your power.</li>

<hr/>
<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> I successfully captured Rome from Italy while maintaining my positions across the board. Germany attempted to attack my position in Livonia with their St. Petersburg army, but I countered by moving my Livonian army to St. Petersburg. France moved into Belgium while I consolidated my dominant position with 17 supply centers.
France and I agreed to continue our pincer movement against Germany, though tensions remain over the Italian territories I've claimed. France wants a 'more equitable division' after Germany falls. England remains committed to France but keeps diplomatic channels open. Germany and Italy made empty threats despite their weak positions. I maintained that my Italian conquests (Rome, Naples, Venice) are part of my eastern sphere of influence.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> I will attack Prussia from multiple directions while maintaining pressure from Berlin and Silesia to eliminate Germany's remaining centers. I'll hold my Italian positions firmly. My strategy is to coordinate with France to eliminate Germany completely, then prepare for the inevitable confrontation with France over the final division of territories. I'll keep diplomatic channels open with England to potentially balance against France in the endgame.</li>
