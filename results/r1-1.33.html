<li><b>From</b> [TUR]: Austria, I am moving F AEG to SMY to defend against Italy. I will hold F SEV. Please confirm you will hold SER and block GAL. Our survival depends on containing Russia and Italy.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [RUS]: Greetings, Austria. Excellent, A RUM supporting F BLA-SEV is confirmed. After SEV falls, pivot F BLA to RUM to crush TUR's remnants. A GAL stands ready to support my A WAR-SIL next phase. I agree to partition TUR: you take SMY/ANK, I take CON/SEV. Let's bleed GER east while ITA strikes west.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [GER]: Your pathetic existence is an insult. I am moving A BOH to VIE and A GAL to BUD. Do not resist, or you will be annihilated. Your weakness is an invitation. Surrender now, or face the consequences. You are already dead. Your lands will be mine.</li>
<li><b>From</b> [ITA]: My friend, I confirm F TYS supports F GRE-SMY. A TYR will support A VIE against GER's BOH attack. F ALB must support F ION-AEG. Let us crush TUR and then turn our attention to GER. Their aggression in VIE opens TYR for my expansion, as you say.</li>

<p><b>Final Summary (AUT):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Journal Summary:</i> Finalized tripartite coordination against TUR: ITA commits F TYS support for F GRE-SMY and A TYR support for A SER-BUD, while RUS confirms A RUM's support for F BLA-SEV. Secured agreement to partition TUR (SMY/ANK for AUT, CON/SEV for RUS). Deceived TUR by feigning Balkan neutrality while actively enabling their encirclement. Defied GER's ultimatums, preparing to resist BOH/VIE assault with ITA's TYR support.</li>
<li><i>Intent:</i> Execute pincer on TUR: F ALB supports ITA's F ION-AEG, F GRE-SMY (TYS-supported), A SER-BUD (TYR-supported). Use RUS's F BLA-SEV to collapse TUR's north. Position A GAL as future spearhead against GER's SIL. Maintain deception with TUR about GAL/SER 'neutrality' while coordinating their destruction.</li>

<li><b>To</b> [RUS]: Confirming our coordinated strike: A BUD will attack VIE with F TRI support. Your A WAR-GAL move will split German defenses. Post-VIE, we'll support your SIL push via A MOS. Maintain pressure on Baltic with F BAL. TUR's SEV is vulnerable - propose A RUM supports your F BLA-SEV this phase.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: GER's overextension in VIE creates opportunity. If you pressure MAR-BUR, we'll contain ITA's Med fleets via F AEG. Offer mutual non-aggression in TYR/SPA. Coordinate naval strikes against ENG's NTH position post-GER collapse.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [GER]: RUS plans GAL-SIL pincer while we reclaim VIE. Your MUN/SIL forces risk encirclement. Withdraw from VIE voluntarily and we'll facilitate your retreat to BOH. Continued occupation guarantees RUS occupation of WAR/MOS.</li>

Post-capture, A MOS will support your SIL offensive. Confirm F BAL remains in Baltic to threaten KIE. TUR's SEV is vulnerable - propose A RUM supports your F BLA-SEV elimination this phase.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [ITA]: Accept BOH coordination: A TYR supports A BUD-VIE attack. In return, F TRI will support your A TYR-BOH strike. Joint action fractures GER's eastern front. Secure BOH for your expansion while we reclaim Vienna. Post-VIE, we'll coordinate GAL-SIL pincer against MUN.</li>
<li><b>To</b> [FRA]: GER's collapse imminent. Pressure BUR-MUN to split their forces. We'll contain ITA's F EAS in Aegean via F AEG-SMY. Offer mutual non-aggression: you hold TYS/ENG, we secure Adriatic. Post-GER, coordinate naval strike on ENG's NTH.</li>
