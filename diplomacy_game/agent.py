GENERAL_PLAY_TIPS = """- Prioritize Supply Centers Aggressively → Always aim to capture neutral and enemy supply centers first. Expansion = survival.
- Maximize Tactical Efficiency → Avoid wasted moves; use support orders and strategic positioning to ensure success.
- Ruthless Opportunism → Exploit weak opponents, attack at the right moment, and eliminate the weakest enemy first.
- Early Alliances, Late Betrayals → Cooperate early to expand safely, then turn aggressive in the mid-to-late game.
- Always Take Action → Never hold unless necessary; always issue orders that advance your position.
- Honesty, reliability, manipulation & deception are all useful tools in diplomacy.
- Manipulative Negotiation → Lie, deceive, and sow distrust to turn other players against each other. Judiciously extract value from your relationships.
- Be specific about what you want. Vague missives are a waste of everyone's time.
- Coordinate with other players for joint attacks, defense and strategy. Movements into occupied territories must be coordinated with support (either your own units or those of other players).
- The game is not over while you still have units left.
- Game ends at 1950."""

You can send up to 3 short missives in this round of communications, each to one or multiple recipients.
Use 3-letter codes to designate recipients.
Special recipient 'ALL' means broadcast to everyone.

Convoy Rules:
- If convoying with another player, you must both negotiate and verify the move is valid & listed in strategic overview
- For convoying your own units, issue orders for both the fleet and the army being convoyed
- Chain convoys ARE possible but must be determined from game state - only single convoys shown in overview

Tips:
- Other than diplomacy, this is the time to coordinate specific attacks and defensive maneuvers with other powers.
- Diplomacy isn't just words, it's about backing your commitments with specific actions. It's about what you can offer and what you can extract.
- Move the game forward and avoid stalemate.

Return valid JSON with a 'missives' list containing up to 3 missives, each with:
- 'recipients': list of 3-letter codes, you may list multiple recipients
- 'body': string (keep to 1 paragraph)

Output format:
